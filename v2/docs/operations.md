# Operations (2.x)

[日本語](operations.ja.md) · [2.x overview](../README.md) · [Setup runbook](../SETUP.md) · [Validation](validation.md)

What to do when a 2.x launch goes wrong, and the routine changes around it: a new container, a new image, a host that powered off, handing the hosts to 1.x. Each section says what the scripts do and which cases the reference hosts met; a case they did not meet is marked as such. Commands run from the checkout root with the cluster file at `state/cluster.env` ([setup §6](../SETUP.md#6-start)), and like every command that changes a host, inside a window the operator has authorized.

## Start outcomes

`cluster.sh state/cluster.env start <label>` ends in one of three ways:

- **`READY after N s`** and rank 0's last eight `[tensorfold]` lines. Read the startup lines, and how long a start took on the reference hosts, in [setup §6](../SETUP.md#6-start).
- **`FAILED on rank R`**: a rank's log has a `Traceback`, or a rank's container runs no engine. The script prints the last 25 lines of every rank's log and exits; it stops nothing. The other ranks and the memory guards may still be running, so run `cluster.sh state/cluster.env status`, then `stop`, before the next start.
- **`TIMEOUT`**: no `serving` line from rank 0 within 15 minutes. Read every rank's log, then `stop` as above.

Each rank logs to `~/glm53-tf/logs/serve-r<RANK>-<LABEL>.log`, which a start with the same label overwrites; give every start its own label to keep the earlier logs. The memory guard appends to `hostwatch-<LABEL>.log`: the time and `MemAvailable` in GiB every 2 s, `KILLED` when it stopped the engine, `done` when the engine is gone.

## A rank stops and the others wait

Two watchers stop one host's engine, each on its own host only:

- **The memory guard** (`hostwatch.sh`, started by `cluster.sh`) stops the engine with `pkill -9` inside the container when `MemAvailable` falls below 5 GiB, and writes `KILLED`.
- **The thermal watch** ([`host/thermal-watch`](../../host/README.md#during-long-runs), started by the operator) stops it after two readings in a row at or above 94 °C, and writes `ABORT`.

The other ranks do not end with it. On 2026-10-04 a thermal watch with the same rule stopped rank 0 six and a half minutes into a 1M-token prefill at TP=3, on an engine without the heat wait. Ranks 1 and 2 logged nothing more: they waited in a collective, and their memory guards kept running, until `cluster.sh state/cluster.env stop` ended them. After any rank stops, stop every rank, find the cause in the guard's or the watch's log, and start every rank again; the records always restarted all ranks together, and starting one rank alone was not tried.

The memory guard never stopped a serving engine on the reference hosts; the lowest `MemAvailable` they reached is in [validation](validation.md#memory-and-temperature). Its way of stopping was verified on a root process in a container: a `pkill` from the host user fails on it with "Operation not permitted" and still returns 0, which is why the guard goes through `docker exec`.

The engine's own heat wait keeps a long prefill below the thermal watch's 94 °C ([serving defaults](../README.md#serving-defaults)). A wait has no time limit: once it starts, the request waits until every host is at or below the lower band, and every rank prints `[tensorfold] heat: waiting <s> s, hottest zone <°C> C` once a minute while it lasts. Those lines mean the room is hot, not that the engine hangs.

## A stop that leaves an engine

`cluster.sh state/cluster.env stop` sends `pkill -f 'tensorfold serve'` inside each container, rank 0 first, waits up to 60 s for each rank's engine to end, and then prints each host's engine-process count and `MemAvailable`. A count above 0 means that rank still runs. `MemAvailable` read right after a stop can be low while the memory is still being freed: 16 GiB right after one stop on the reference pair, 117 GiB 20 s later.

Every stop in the reference records ended with 0 on every rank, so the next steps were never needed there. They would be, on the host whose count stays above 0: the guard's form, `docker exec glm53-tf pkill -9 -f 'tensorfold serve'`, or `docker stop glm53-tf`, which ends every process in the container. Then `cluster.sh state/cluster.env status` again.

## NCCL over sockets

The ranks must talk over RoCE, not TCP sockets:

- `create_container.sh` refuses a host without `/dev/infiniband`, where NCCL would fall back to sockets.
- The rank files' `NCCL_DEBUG=INFO` and `NCCL_DEBUG_SUBSYS=INIT,NET` make NCCL log each connection's transport once at start. `grep 'via NET' ~/glm53-tf/logs/serve-r<RANK>-<LABEL>.log` lists them; each must name `NET/IB`. At TP=2 the lines name both rails, `NET/IB/0` and `NET/IB/1`, in equal numbers; with one rail named, check `NCCL_IB_HCA`.
- When a connection is not `NET/IB`, check the rank file against the host: `NCCL_IB_HCA` (the RDMA devices on the links, both rails), `NCCL_IB_GID_INDEX` (the RoCE v2 entry on the link's IPv4 address) and `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME` (the interface the ranks meet on), recorded in [setup §1](../SETUP.md#1-hosts-and-fabric). A GID index can move after a link drops or a host loses power ([a GID index that moves](../../docs/nccl-validation.md#a-gid-index-that-moves)). The [NCCL diagnostic](../../docs/nccl-validation.md) tests the fabric without the engine.

Every recorded 2.x start ran every connection over `NET/IB`.

## Recreate the container

After `cluster.sh state/cluster.env stop`, on each host:

```sh
docker rm -f glm53-tf                                  # the container only sleeps between starts
v2/scripts/create_container.sh glm53-tf:2.1.1
docker exec glm53-tf bash /opt/glm53-tf/build_ext.sh
```

`create_container.sh` names the container, so the old one must go first. The host directory `~/glm53-tf` stays: the rank file, the compiled extensions (`ext/`) and the logs. `build_ext.sh` builds the extensions that are missing for the image and finds the others already built; run it before every first start in a new container.

## Move to a new image

A new image is a new engine build: accept it again before routine use.

1. Build it on one host ([setup §3](../SETUP.md#3-image)). On every host, keep the image in use under a second tag first (`docker tag glm53-tf:2.1.1 glm53-tf:2.1.1-<engine>`, as the records did), so that going back is a container away.
2. Load it on the other hosts and compare the image IDs of every host; they must be equal. The ID that `docker images` shows also covers the build's provenance and changes with each checkout the image is built from ([changelog 2.0.0](../CHANGELOG.md)).
3. Stop, then recreate the container on every host from the new image and run `build_ext.sh` ([above](#recreate-the-container)). For each new engine on the reference hosts it rebuilt all seven extensions, about 155-160 s a host.
4. Start, and run [validation](validation.md) from the decode check on. A new engine must give the reference hashes; one that does not is a finding to explain, not a value to replace.

To go back, recreate the containers from the kept tag.

## A host that powered off

GB10 hosts can power off under sustained load ([GPU clock cap](../../docs/hosts.md#gpu-clock-cap)); the reference hosts did not under 2.x, so this section is the scripts' reading, not a recorded recovery. The clock cap, the cooling gate between long requests and the thermal watch ([host tools](../../host/README.md#during-long-runs)) are the prevention.

- The ranks on the other hosts wait in a collective, as above: stop them.
- `create_container.sh` sets no restart policy, so after the host boots its `glm53-tf` container is not running: `docker start glm53-tf`, or recreate it.
- Before starting, check the host as [host preparation](../../docs/hosts.md) says after an unclean restart (loaded clocks and power) and its GID index ([a GID index that moves](../../docs/nccl-validation.md#a-gid-index-that-moves)); the reference pair's peer moved one rail's index after its head lost power under 1.x.
- Start every rank together and run the decode check before routine use.

## Hand the hosts to 1.x

```sh
v2/scripts/cluster.sh state/cluster.env stop
docker stop glm53-tf          # on every host
```

A stopped engine is not enough. The container was created with every GPU, and 1.x's `server preflight` refuses a launch while another running container requests a GPU: on 2026-10-04 it refused with `exclusive_gpu` false while `glm53-tf` containers that only slept, with no GPU process, ran on the hosts ([1.x launch checks](../../v1/docs/operations.md#full-model-launch-checks)). `docker start glm53-tf` gives the hosts back to 2.x, with the same container and `~/glm53-tf`; stop the 1.x server first, as the [requirements](../README.md#requirements) say.
