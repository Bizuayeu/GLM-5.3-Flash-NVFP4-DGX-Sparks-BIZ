# Decisions (2.x)

[日本語](decisions.ja.md) · [2.x overview](../README.md) · [Validation](validation.md) · [Benchmark method](benchmarks.md)

What was tried for the 2.x line, what was adopted or rejected, when, with the measured effect and what would reopen it: the 2.x counterpart of 1.x's [optimization catalog](../../v1/docs/optimization-catalog.md). The effects were measured on the reference hosts under the GPU clock cap, on the development build where each decision was taken, at TP=2 on the pair unless the row says TP=3; prefill is the median of three 38,960-token prompts ([benchmark method](benchmarks.md)). The release's own figures are in [measured on the release](../README.md#measured-on-the-release) and the reference values in [validation](validation.md). "—" means nothing recorded would reopen the decision.

## Engine

| Decision | Date | Measured effect | Reopens when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Serve with TensorFold in place of vLLM | 2026-10-02 | Exactness is the engine's contract (drafted equals serial, resumed equals fresh, the result does not depend on the chunking), where 1.x buys repeatability by turning vLLM's switches on ([differences from 1.x](../README.md#differences-from-1x)) | — |
| Start from upstream TensorFold and port only what GLM needs, not build on MiaAI-Lab's TensorFold recipe | 2026-10-02 | Its FP8 latent KV (patch 0038) sat on about 37 earlier patches; a dry run onto upstream 0.6.1 failed nearly every hunk, so it was rewritten on upstream (about 600 lines) | — |
| Follow upstream releases, upstream's side winning a conflict | 2026-10-03 | v0.6.2, v0.6.3, v0.6.4, then v0.6.5 (2.1.0, without a conflict), v0.6.4 being where the TP=3 exchanges were rebuilt on upstream's communicator interface (#219). The stop on every rank is upstream pull request #301 taken as it is, rather than written anew | Upstream releases another 0.6.x of its Python engine, or serves GLM from its Zig engine; it froze the Python engine (issue #286) and closed #301, #320 and #333 with it ([Next Action](../README.md#next-action)) |
| No CPU set for the serving containers (`create_container.sh` leaves placement to the kernel) | 2026-10-05 | Unpinned, the engine's threads ran on all twenty cores, the efficiency cores included; pinning both ranks to the performance cores (`docker update --cpuset-cpus 5-9,15-19`) moved decode and prefill within noise (counting 41.35 → 41.36 tok/s, prefill 1,327 → 1,329 tok/s). 1.x needs the pin ([CPU placement](../../v1/docs/benchmarks.md#cpu-placement-on-the-reference-pair-2026-09-26)) | One rank decodes slower than the other at the same settings |
| Upstream #285, #294, patch 0080 (rewritten) and the TR3 name ride on 2.5.0's engine | 2026-10-08 | Taken when the engine's release branch was next cut, not in a release of their own: #285 (MiaAI-Lab; a GLM tool call whose end token arrived before `</tool_call>` is sent when it parses whole) and #294 (plotarmordev; the open-file limit raised at start) as they are, with their authors; MiaAI-Lab's patch 0080 rewritten (an image marker quoted in the conversation stays text beside a real picture; no code copied) and named in the engine's notices; the EXL3/TR3 checkpoint named as `brandonmusic/GLM-5.3-Flash-tr3-4bpw`, with Mia-AiLab's withdrawn re-host kept in the list. On the default path (no image, no tools) the tokens are unchanged; 2.5.0's acceptance is in [measured on the release](../README.md#measured-on-the-release) | — |
| #294's timing-dependent test fixed in the fork | 2026-10-08 | Upstream's test could fail by timing: the test server closed an accepted socket on its worker thread, sometimes between the test's squeeze and the next accept. The fork's test closes it in place | — |

## Precision and memory

| Decision | Date | Measured effect | Reopens when |
|---|---|---|---|
| FP8 latent KV (`TF_GLM_KV=fp8`) with a power-of-two scale per row | 2026-10-02 | The KV of a token takes 12,912 bytes a rank across the 12 layers with a latent cache (11 DSA layers and the MTP layer), against 19,200 with BF16 KV (−33%); the TP=2 window with BF16 KV was 344,820 tokens against about 490K with FP8 on that build. Drafted replies still equal serial ones; lossy against BF16 KV ([limits](../README.md#limits)). The checkpoint declares FP8 KV but stores no KV scale (vLLM uses 1.0), hence the per-row scale. The indexer ring of the same patch (keys and gates in a ring) was not ported: it changes the BF16 default's layout | More window per rank is needed; the ring is the next step |
| Routed experts and the dense MLP as W4A16; `--precision checkpoint` refused | 2026-10-02 | Upstream's grouped NVFP4 expert kernel takes BF16 rows only, with no input-scale path; in the pinned checkpoint the activation scales would change only dense layers 0-2 | — |
| The MTP layer's routed experts quantized to NVFP4 for drafting only | 2026-10-02 | BF16 in the checkpoint (13.5 GiB): 6.75 GiB a rank at TP=2 down to 1.90 GiB. The full model verifies every drafted token, so replies are unchanged | — |
| The KDA conv taps kept fp32, as stored | 2026-10-02 | An earlier build rounded them to BF16 for the kernels; the kernels now read fp32, as 1.x's vLLM keeps them. MLX and EXL3 checkpoints, whose taps are BF16, give the same tokens and caches as before (12 of 12) | — |
| TP=3 shares cut at unit boundaries, the remainder to the lower ranks | 2026-10-03 | Heads 22/21/21, MoE width 704/704/640, vocabulary 51,648/51,648/51,584: no zero rows, the weights untouched. At two ranks the cut equals the halves byte for byte on every tensor. Weight estimates 63.04/62.87/57.70 GiB on ranks 0/1/2 | — |
| The published AXL weights not supported | 2026-10-04 | Capacity does not need them: on the pinned weights TP=2 holds more window than 1.x. At TP=3 they would act only on the part of a prefill that does not grow with length, at most 12 ms a chunk, about 1% of that part (2026-10-03) | Reopened in 2.4.0 (the next row) |
| The published AXL weights load by their tensors, as an option; the pinned checkpoint stays the default (`CHECKPOINT` in the rank files) | 2026-10-07 | The engine picks the path per tensor, with no switch: a projection with `weight_scale` loads as an NVFP4 linear layer (the decode lane matmul and the prompt GEMM), `kv_b` is dequantized to fp32 for the latent path, and the ranks' startup agreement includes the checkpoint's kind. On the pinned checkpoint the bits are unchanged (the tiny model's bit checks, the decode-check token ids and the NLL set equal 2.3.0's). At TP=2 AXL ran faster than the pinned weights on the decode check and edits, at a higher NLL on every domain and a smaller startup estimate (2.4.0 in [measured on the release](../README.md#measured-on-the-release)) | — |

## Window, limits and scope

| Decision | Date | Measured effect | Reopens when |
|---|---|---|---|
| TP=2 window 300,000 tokens, not the 567,255 of `--context 0` | 2026-10-04 | Leaves the default 3 GiB for other conversations' kept prompts ([why 300,000](../README.md#serving-defaults)) | A deployment passes another `--context` |
| TP=3 window: the largest that fits (`--context 0`) | used from 2026-10-03, the shipped default from 2026-10-04 | 1,048,576 tokens, the model's limit, on the reference ring | — |
| Replies of up to 32,768 tokens when a request names no limit | 2026-10-03 | — | — |
| Prefill chunk of 4,096 rows | rejected 2026-10-02 | 1,076.1 tok/s against 1,169.9 with 2,048 rows on the same build, and a window of about 405K instead of about 490K; the bits were the same | — |
| One sequence at a time | 2026-10-02 | The engine's CUDA path decodes one GLM request at a time | This line takes #243, which upstream closed with the freeze, into its release branch ([Next Action](../README.md#next-action)) |
| No image input in 2.0.0 | 2026-10-04 | The engine refuses images for GLM on CUDA | Reopened in 2.1.0 with #194 (the next row) |
| Image input from upstream pull request #194, carried to three ranks, on by default (`VISION=1` in the example rank files) | 2026-10-05 | #194 encodes on rank 0 and sends the features, which three ranks needed only its gather widened for. The 2.1.0 acceptance read one image, a 4:3 image of 7,966 prompt tokens, two in order, a single colour and an image in a tool result at both TP sizes, and the token ids without images stayed 2.0.0's with it on. The window stays; at TP=2 the 1.05 GiB tower leaves 2.4 GiB of the 3 GiB for kept prompts, which was taken for images by default | Upstream merges #194; the kept prompts' 2.4 GiB proves short for long conversations at TP=2 |

## Drafts

| Decision | Date | Measured effect | Reopens when |
|---|---|---|---|
| The checkpoint's MTP head drafts (`--drafter none`), not DFlash2 | 2026-10-04 | Named explicitly: the engine's `--drafter auto` would take DFlash2 at TP=2 when its weights are in the cache and refuse it at TP=3 (it splits only over two ranks). DFlash2's weights' terms are also why 1.x does not use it | — |
| The engine's draft-depth policy (`auto`), no fixed `--mtp-drafts` | 2026-10-05 | Fixed depths 4 and 5 against auto, decode: counting +8% and +14%, prose −15% and −20%, code −2%; at temperature 1.0 auto stayed ahead (prose 24.7 against 20.9 tok/s at depth 4). The token ids were the same at every depth and in serial replies, at temperature 0 and 1.0. Why auto wins: each round verifies the drafts in one forward and keeps them up to the first miss, and every verified row costs time. Auto drafts at most three; at temperature 0 it ends a chain once the MTP head's probability for the next draft falls under 0.35, and when sampling it moves the depth between one and three with the running acceptance. A fixed depth drafts N every round, so prose, where drafts are often rejected, pays for rows it throws away, while counting, where three drafts are nearly always accepted, gains from more (the engine's start-time costs choose between MTP and DFlash2 and do not set this depth) | Auto's ceiling of three drafts can be raised for text that accepts nearly every draft |

## Fabric

| Decision | Date | Measured effect | Reopens when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Two rails per link | 2026-10-02 (TP=2), 2026-10-03 (TP=3) | TP=2 prefill +4% on the same build (two rails give [validation's](validation.md#prefill-and-decode-speed) TP=2 reference); TP=3 1,225.1 → 1,384.7 tok/s (+13%); decode unchanged and the decode-check hashes the same at both | — |
| TP=3: four NCCL channels, NCCL's own IB transport (`NCCL_NET_PLUGIN=none`), subnet-aware routing | 2026-10-03 | The second rail took an 8 MiB piece from 1,530 to about 900 µs, with 2, 4, 8 or 64 channels alike; four channels shortened a 32 MiB chunk (9,236 → 5,072 µs on one rail, 3,622 → 3,346 on two). Decode-sized exchanges (23-51 µs) moved within noise. `NCCL_CROSS_NIC` and the image's default network plugin changed nothing | — |
| TP=2: four NCCL channels, and the IB transport named in the rank files as TP=3 names it | 2026-10-05 | Against the 64 channels NCCL opens on its own: decode +0.8–1.0%, about 1.5 GiB more room in the start's estimate, the lowest MemAvailable 1–2 GiB higher, prefill within 0.4% (eight channels measured alike). Naming `NCCL_NET=IB` and the rest changed nothing measured: every connection was NET/IB before | — |

## Prefill

| Decision | Date | Measured effect | Reopens when |
|---|---|---|---|
| A prompt kernel for the NVFP4 routed experts (`b0fa0a5`) | 2026-10-02 | Expert time 18.55 → 9.2 s a prompt, prefill 769.3 → 913.7 tok/s (+19%). Its prompt bits differ from the decode kernel's (a pair's bits depend only on its row and expert, so chunking still does not change them), so the decode-check hashes changed once here; the reference hashes postdate it. A faster form summing the whole K inside the tensor cores (2.64× against 2.5-2.6×) was rejected for five times the down projection's error | — |
| BF16 prompt matmuls sum their K slices in registers (#333); DSA prompt kernels on more programs | 2026-10-02 | 943.7 → 1,068.2 tok/s, same bits | — |
| A prompt chunk's exchanges in four row pieces on a second stream | 2026-10-02 | 1,068.2 → 1,150.7 tok/s; two and eight pieces gave 1,119.6 and 1,116.6 | — |
| The KDA prompt step kernel with eight warps a block | 2026-10-02 | 1,150.7 → 1,169.9 tok/s, same bits | — |
| BF16 split-K partials reserved for short windows only | 2026-10-02 | The window at `--context 0` grew from about 490K to 567,255 tokens; prefill unchanged | — |
| The prefill exchange `split` as the default (`TF_GLM_PREFILL_REDUCE`) | 2026-10-03 | TP=3, in one window of launches: against the earlier `gather` (1,394-1,398 tok/s), `scatter` +6.8% and `split` +19.6%; every decode-check hash and the NLL set unchanged. Taken where the ranks can send to each other; elsewhere `gather`. At TP=2 (2026-10-06, 2.1.1) `split` ran about 5% faster than `gather` in both of the prompt's two speeds (1,326 against 1,262 tok/s, 1,228 against 1,171), with the same decode-check token ids and texts | — |
| The indexer's prompt work: 16 rows a program, only the pool columns selection reads, a long row read three times instead of five | 2026-10-03 | On one GPU with a real DSA layer, a chunk's token selection at 1M tokens 209.5 → 165.5 ms (−21%), same bits; with the exchange work above, the 200K and 500K runs fit a shorter 1M prefill ([long inputs](validation.md#long-inputs)). Tried and slower: the histogram fused into scoring, three 11-bit passes, a persistent grid, blocks of 2,048 | — |
| Prefill ideas that change bits | rejected 2026-10-02 and 03 | Scoring 32 heads of a row block as one GEMM with the head sum moved after it (estimated at about 240 s off a 1M prefill if it scored twice as fast), scoring on FP8 tensor cores, a chunked KDA (its recurrence is 2.06 s of a 38,960-token prompt, a gain of a few percent at most), MiaAI-Lab's single-pass sparse attention. Each changes, or may change, the bits behind the reference hashes and NLL | — |

## Heat

| Decision | Date | Measured effect | Reopens when |
|---|---|---|---|
| A prefill waits between chunks at 92 °C until 88 °C, every rank together | 2026-10-04 | Without it, a 1M-token prompt at TP=3 reached the thermal watch's 94 °C after six and a half minutes; with it the prompt completed ([heat](../README.md#measured-on-the-release)). The per-chunk exchange of the hottest reading cost about 0.2% of a 38,960-token prefill. 92 °C sits 2 °C under the stop (near the top a host rose 0.5-1 °C a minute; a chunk takes seconds); 88 °C sits under the 88.8-89.6 °C a 1M prefill held before the faster prefill work | Upstream's Zig engine serves GLM, where it said it would follow issue #339's design ([Next Action](../README.md#next-action)); the bands are the rank file's to change |
| The wait also looks one chunk ahead: before a chunk, the hottest zone plus the last chunk's rise must stay within 93 °C (`TF_GLM_HEAT_CEILING`), and a wait ends only when it would | 2026-10-07 | Near the end of a 1M-token prompt a chunk adds about 7 °C after the check between chunks: at 92 °C one host read 94.3 °C once (2.2.0). With the look-ahead the hottest host peaked at 92.6 °C; the prompt at TP=3 waited 350.3 s against 64.1 s, the prefill without waits the same. Lowering the bands to 86 °C / 82 °C instead peaked at 93.0 °C but waited 436.4 s, and a 38,960-token prompt on warm hosts waited too | A host reads 94 °C twice in a row, or a check within a chunk |
| How the wait is made | 2026-10-04 | One word gathered on its own before each chunk, not added to the existing exchange, whose result the host does not read; the ACPI zones only, as the thermal watch and the cooling gate read (the GPU ran about 9 °C cooler in every record); no limit on a wait, so a hot room holds the request and the thermal watch stays the last guard; off unless both bands are set, so upstream's default does not change | — |

## Decode

Measured at TP=2 on 2026-10-06 in one window of ten launches of one build, each switch turned off alone between launches with all on; every launch gave 2.1.4's decode-check token ids and the same edit reply. Each figure is the mean of the two launches with all on beside it against the two with that switch off.

| Decision | Date | Measured effect | Reopens when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Copy drafts (`TF_GLM_COPY_DRAFTS`): when the last 8 tokens of the reply occurred earlier in the prompt or reply (16 inside the reply), the tokens that followed are drafted, up to 5 a round, right after a miss too (`MISS_MOST`, the next row); verified like any draft. After MiaAI-Lab's patches 0007 and the first half of 0032 | 2026-10-06 | `bench --kinds edit` (a module returned whole with three named edits) 43.0 → 57.6 tok/s (+34%, 240 of 251 rounds copied); the decode check's counting +3.6% (acceptance 3.821 → 3.961); prose, code, `bench` decode and prefill within ±0.3% | A miss-heavy load slows replies: then measure fewer drafts after a miss (measured on 2026-10-07, the next row) |
| Copy drafts after a miss: up to 5, no fewer than other rounds (`MISS_MOST` 5, 3 before 2.4.0) | 2026-10-07 | In a window of its own, six launches at TP=2 alternating 3 and 5, on edits and on two loads whose copies miss often: the module returned with five renames (10.1% of copied drafts missed at 3) and unit tests written for it (41%). 5 against 3: edits 58.12 against 57.57 tok/s (+1.0%), renames 45.94 against 45.49 (+1.0%), tests 39.12 against 39.14 (−0.05%), the decode check within ±0.3%; every launch gave the same token ids and replies. The cost expected of 5, each miss verified in a window of six rows, was offset by fewer rounds (renames 351 → 344). An earlier window the same day, on edits only, gave 57.5 and 57.9 tok/s for 1 and 5 against 57.4 for 3 | — |
| KDA decode windows on the three-kernel chain (`TF_GLM_KDA_DECODE_WIDE`), as prompt chunks of 64 rows or more already ran. After MiaAI-Lab's patch 0016c | 2026-10-06 | Decode +0.6% (`bench`), decode check +0.5%, prefill unchanged. On one GPU the chain itself is 27% faster at one row and 58% at eight. The same bits as the fused kernel at 1 to 8 rows, with and without graphs | — |
| Per-shape tiles for the BF16 decode matmuls (`TF_GLM_B16_DECODE_TABLE`): 12 shapes on a swept tile, the rest on 64×4×3; the K slices count fixed 64-wide tiles, so the tile no longer sets the sum order | 2026-10-06 | Decode +0.9% (`bench`), decode check +0.9%, prefill unchanged; at TP=3 the swept shapes add up to 0.1-0.2% of a step. All 32 launchable tiles gave today's bits on all 26 decode shapes at 1 to 16 rows | Another GPU or engine build: sweep again (`tools/bench_glm_b16_decode.py` in the engine) |
| The latent path holds DSA's kv_b once, as its per-head copy; the key and value rows are built only with `TF_GLM_LATENT=0` | 2026-10-06 | 192 MiB more per rank at TP=2 (126-132 MiB at TP=3); rank 0's startup estimate 101.53 → 101.35 GiB | — |
| `bench --kinds decode` stops at the limit with a fixed counting request, not `ignore_eos`: `Write the numbers from 1 to 1000, one per line, and nothing else.`, up to 512 tokens (2.5.0) | 2026-10-08 | Outside the window above, at TP=2 on 2.4.0's engine. The old request (`Count upward from one, one number per line.`, `ignore_eos`) rated what each model made up past its own end, so AXL's row ran only 2% over the pinned weights' (2.4.0 in [measured on the release](../README.md#measured-on-the-release)). Of two counting requests without `ignore_eos`, each run twice on both weights, both counted until the limit; this one gave the same reply token for token on both weights, the other did not. With it AXL ran 34% over the pinned weights, the decode check's direction. A row whose `finish_reason` is not `length` stopped early and does not compare ([benchmark method](benchmarks.md#prefill-and-decode-speed)) | — |

## Engine commits not named elsewhere

The release branch is upstream v0.6.5 plus the commits that the [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md) groups. These are the ones it does not name, tests and recipe text aside:

- `0c9e8da`: `/v1/completions` takes token-id prompts and returns vLLM-shaped `prompt_logprobs` for GLM, which the NLL check (`score-nll`) needs; a request without it is unchanged, and one with it never resumes a kept prompt.
- `68a7e6a`: the NVFP4 routed experts' prompt kernel (above).
- `e190c7b`, `9c51f2f`: the KDA conv taps in fp32 (above).
- `aac7927`: DSA's prompt absorb and expand over row blocks, and the indexer's pool scores four rows a program (after MiaAI-Lab's patch 0009; 16 later, the row above).
- `2caf43c`: the KDA prompt step kernel with eight warps (above).
- `bee087d`: the BF16 split-K partials only for short windows (above).
- `c35cfd9`: the startup estimate counts the draft head's rows as packed, so every rank of three loads exactly its estimate.
- `c3ec51d`: `send_recv` as an optional capability of upstream's communicator interface, which `split` uses.
- `d5e65e2`: a rank can load only chosen layers, for the tests against the real checkpoint.
- `9c78e43`, `aba0f21`, `4a41c21`, `d21c834`: what 2.1.0 adds to upstream pull request #194 (its seven commits, `4fcfb10` to `f9ee1d9`): one image up to the checkpoint's 8,000 visual tokens, rank 0's image workspace from a measurement of the tower, the image features on every rank of three, and `--vision-offload` refused on a GPU that shares the host's memory.
- `eaf06cc`, `1a3fb17` (2.1.1): each image of a request is its own call of the image tower, since an image encoded in one call with others got different features.
- `e735c14`, `a265436` (2.1.4): TensorFold pull request #421 (m-naoki-m), kept in the release branch since upstream froze its Python engine: `_take_over` decides which kept prompts stay before copying any (issue #420); the fake snapshots of two upstream tests carry `drafter_rows`.
- `81bd22f` to `440e631` (2.2.0): the four decode items above with their tests, the tile sweep tool, and the switch of the BF16 tiles joining the ranks' startup agreement.

## Measures from 1.x not yet evaluated on 2.x

Open items: 1.x measured them; 2.x has no result either way.

- **MTU.** 1.x measured 9000 against 1500 and stayed at 1500 ([channel count](../../docs/nccl-validation.md#channel-count)); 2.x did not vary it.
- **LPA.** 1.x's late-prefill approximation is experimental and a batch opt-in there ([LPA](../../v1/docs/lpa.md)); it changes a long prefill's result by design. 2.x has no counterpart, and its reference hashes and NLL are those of the exact prefill.
