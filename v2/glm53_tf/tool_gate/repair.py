"""Stop a tool call whose arguments break its schema and let the model answer once more (assembly layer).

A non-streamed violating turn is not returned; a streamed one has already relayed its content and
reasoning by the time its calls are checked, and only its calls are withheld. Either way it is
added to the conversation with a tool reply per call, the one the model would have received had
the call reached a real tool, and the model is asked once more. A second violation is returned as it is: the gate does not hide what the model does.
