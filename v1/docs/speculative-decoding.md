# MTP speculative decoding

[日本語](speculative-decoding.ja.md) · [Baseline benchmarks](benchmarks.md)

The first TP=2 baseline used no speculation. The speculative profiles use the MTP tensors already in the pinned NVIDIA checkpoint. No external draft model, EXL3 conversion or DFlash2 weights are needed; this introduces no additional model license. Existing [artifact licenses](licensing.md) still apply.

Depths one to five have been measured, all five with the requantized checkpoint and 1, 3 and 4 with the pinned one. **The template keeps k=3, and k=3 is also the depth the reference pair serves with the requantized checkpoint** ([the decision of 2026-09-21](#depth-three-for-both-checkpoints-2026-09-21)). MTP k=3 is part of the distributed defaults, accepted for routine use ([SETUP step 6](../SETUP.md#6-qualify-the-full-model)). [Depths one to five](#depths-one-to-five-2026-09-19-and-20) holds the sweep that led there; the k=1 and k=3 sections below are the earlier, smaller runs. [Beyond a fixed depth](#beyond-a-fixed-depth-2026-09-21) records what was tried after the sweep and why none of it is adopted.

## Why a flag alone is insufficient

The fixed checkpoint contains 889 MTP tensors at layer 45: 888 BF16 and one F32, totaling 13.844 GiB. Standard MTP configuration inherits `modelopt_fp4`, while the supplied quantization exclusions do not cover the MTP layer. Applying that global NVFP4 interpretation to these floating-point tensors is incorrect.

The tested candidate adds `*.layers.45.*` to the modern and legacy quantization exclusion metadata **in a separate view**. Original weights and snapshot metadata remain unchanged. Layers 0–44 retain their original quantization. The draft uses Triton unquantized MoE; the target continues using Marlin W4A16. A draft-only metadata view is insufficient for this pinned loader, which also consumes the target's `VllmConfig`.

## Prepare a view on each Linux host

First complete official checksum verification of the original snapshot. From this checkout, create a fresh view under the same Hugging Face cache root so relative links survive a common container mount:

```sh
HF_ROOT="$HOME/.cache/huggingface"
REVISION=$(python -c 'from glm53_setup.config import REVISION; print(REVISION)')
python tools/prepare_mtp_view.py \
  --snapshot "$HF_ROOT/hub/models--nvidia--GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4/snapshots/$REVISION" \
  --output "$HF_ROOT/local-views/glm53-mtp-compatible/$REVISION"
```

The tool checks the declared MTP tensor headers and refuses quantized MTP data rather than silently treating it as BF16. Header inspection is not a substitute for the preceding full checksum. It creates links and modified metadata, not a second copy of the tensor data. Keep the emitted provenance/hash report privately and compare the view configuration on both nodes. Use a new destination; existing views are preserved.

Set `mtp.view` to this path relative to the cache (`local-views/glm53-mtp-compatible`; the launcher appends the revision). With `mtp.enabled = true`, `server start` serves the view, mounts the whole cache root read-only (the view's links point into the snapshot) and builds `--speculative-config` from `mtp.num_speculative_tokens` with `mtp` and a separate `triton` MoE backend for the draft. [speculative.mtp1.json](../examples/speculative.mtp1.json) and [speculative.mtp3.json](../examples/speculative.mtp3.json) show the JSON it passes, for a manual `vllm serve` reproduction. `mtp.enabled = false` serves the original snapshot; keep the view. A profile with `runtime.derived_checkpoint` loads the draft layer without the view ([server configuration](server-configuration.md#attention-cache-and-checkpoint)).

## Acceptance and comparison

- Confirm the target remains NVFP4/Marlin while the MTP modules load as unquantized floating-point layers; never fill nonexistent quantization scales with dummy values.
- Record actual memory and maintain host headroom. Tensor payload division alone predicts about 6.92 GiB per TP rank, but replicated parameters, temporary storage and KV require measurement.
- Repeat the same official benchmark workload and independent completed-request/output-count checks used for the baseline. Keep warmup and client concurrency explicit.
- Save raw `/metrics` snapshots before/after each case. Draft acceptance is the accepted-draft-token delta divided by the draft-token delta; conventional mean acceptance length includes the bonus token: `1 + accepted_token_delta / draft_count_delta`. The case window may include warmup and the client's initial probe, so it is distinct from measured-request-only timing. See [vLLM's metric definitions](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/v0.24.0/api/vllm/v1/spec_decode/metrics/).
- Compare depths by mean acceptance length, not by acceptance rate. A deeper k lowers the rate even when it yields more tokens per step; another recipe ranked k=5 and k=7 the wrong way round by rate (tonyd2wild PR #12, no code adopted).
- Check final answers, tools, SSE, EOS/length termination and state behavior. Keep greedy token/logprob differences as numerical diagnostics instead of demanding identical free-form reasoning text.
- Compare both prefill latency and decode/aggregate throughput. A faster decode path can still lose on long-input, short-output workloads.

amasu reports similar aggregate scores at k=3 and k=4 in its own configuration (benchmark §12, commit `73e19d8`). That external result does not select a depth for this setup; use the local comparison below.

## Measured k=1 results

The first full-model runs, on 2026-09-12 (Asia/Tokyo), since superseded by [depth three](#depth-three-for-both-checkpoints-2026-09-21). The image, target arithmetic, network and five workloads match the [MTP-off baseline](benchmarks.md#initial-full-model-results); these are separate runs, not an A/B/A. Client concurrency 2 still queues behind server `max_num_seqs=1`.

| Input tokens | Client concurrency | MTP median TTFT (s) | Decode off → k=1 (token/s) | Aggregate output off → k=1 (token/s) | Draft acceptance |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 32 | 1 | 0.267 | 14.29 → 24.14 | 13.71 → 22.15 | 92.4% |
| 2,048 | 1 | 6.522 | 14.15 → 22.37 | 6.06 → 6.85 | 91.0% |
| 8,192 | 1 | 26.257 | 13.96 → 20.55 | 2.21 → 2.18 | 70.5% |
| 32 | 2 | 3.116 | 14.27 → 23.54 | 13.71 → 21.38 | 85.7% |
| 2,048 | 2 | 15.820 | 14.22 → 21.49 | 6.08 → 6.80 | 84.0% |

Decode is `1000 / mean_tpot_ms`; acceptance uses the per-case counter windows described above, warmup included. All 21 requests produced their 64 tokens, mean acceptance length was 1.70–1.92, model memory was 95.17 GiB per rank (about 6.97 GiB more than without MTP) and all 11 basic API checks passed. Short-input decode rose about 1.69×, while the 8,192-token input lost about 1.3% of aggregate throughput and its TTFT rose from 24.387 to 26.257 s.

## Measured k=3 comparison

A separate run the same day changed only the depth from 1 to 3. The runtime enlarged the aligned attention block from 4,352 to 4,608 tokens as a consequence of k=3.

| Input tokens | Client concurrency | k=3 median TTFT (s) | Decode k=1 → k=3 (token/s) | Aggregate output k=1 → k=3 (token/s) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 32 | 1 | 0.376 | 24.14 → 30.30 | 22.15 → 26.35 |
| 2,048 | 1 | 6.628 | 22.37 → 30.14 | 6.85 → 7.34 |
| 8,192 | 1 | 26.427 | 20.55 → 22.25 | 2.18 → 2.19 |
| 32 | 2 | 2.602 | 23.54 → 25.41 | 21.38 → 22.61 |
| 2,048 | 2 | 15.305 | 21.49 → 27.04 | 6.80 → 7.19 |

Per-position acceptance is accepted tokens at that position divided by all draft steps, not conditional on the previous position.

| Case | Position 1 | Position 2 | Position 3 | Mean acceptance length |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| short-c1 | 88.2% | 77.6% | 76.3% | 3.42 |
| medium-c1 | 75.3% | 67.1% | 58.8% | 3.01 |
| long-c1 | 65.7% | 45.7% | 36.2% | 2.48 |
| short-c2 | 70.3% | 64.6% | 52.5% | 2.87 |
| medium-c2 | 73.1% | 62.8% | 54.5% | 2.90 |

All 21 requests completed, all 11 API checks passed and model memory stayed at 95.17 GiB per rank. Over k=1, k=3 improved short-input decode by 25.5% and medium-input decode by 34.7%; the long-input aggregate gain (0.45%) was too small to call. k=3 was therefore preferred for the evaluations that followed.

## Depths one to five (2026-09-19 and 20)

`mtp.num_speculative_tokens` accepts 1 to 5. The draft has one layer, so a depth above one runs the same draft again and acceptance falls with depth; what a deeper step buys depends on how predictable the text is. The decode measure is nine samples of 512 tokens after a fixed 2,048-token prompt, median tok/s, with the mean acceptance length in brackets; both tables ran FA2 prefill, the fixed expert order and one sequence on the reference pair.

With the requantized attention projections (`runtime.derived_checkpoint`, route g):

| Prompt | k=1 | k=3 | k=4 | k=5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Counting | 30.64 (1.98) | 42.17 (3.79) | 45.13 (4.68) | 45.89 (5.41) |
| Prose | 26.67 (1.77) | 24.95 (2.15) | 24.28 (2.36) | 20.55 (2.30) |
| Code | 29.07 (1.88) | 34.84 (3.15) | 34.59 (3.65) | 30.27 (3.66) |
| Short prompts (`glm_bench`) | 28.51 | 27.19 | 37.79 | 36.33 |

Teacher-forced NLL was the same to four decimals at every depth, and the 199,652-token passphrase request was answered correctly at k=3 (166.5 s) and k=4 (164.3 s). k=2 was dropped from the sweep after its nine completions came out in three variants, and the k=4 prose run above came out in two; both were the [indexer top-k tie](validation.md#repeatability), not the depth, and with `runtime.stable_indexer_topk` k=4 repeats nine of nine (prose 24.68, counting 45.99, short prompts 38.82).

With the pinned checkpoint as it is, both depths with the tie settled: counting 33.08 at k=4 against 32.50 at k=3, prose 19.60 against 21.00, code 28.37 against 28.30, short prompts 28.10 against 27.17. The requantized projections make every step cheaper, so the longer verification step of a deeper draft costs relatively less there; without them depth four gains 0 to 3% where the text is predictable and loses 7% on prose.

## Depth three for both checkpoints (2026-09-21)

After that sweep the template kept k=3 while the reference pair served k=4 with `runtime.derived_checkpoint` for two days. The sweep was then repeated on ten inputs, three repeats each, on the reference pair with the requantized attention projections (route g, FA2 prefill, one sequence, 512 tokens per request): four regression inputs (the three decode prompts above and a short counting prompt) and, split by document into a tuning and an evaluation set, Japanese prose, code and a tool round-trip. Median tok/s with the mean acceptance length in brackets. Every arm repeated its own completions; **the completion of most inputs changes with the depth** (the draft's candidates enter the verification batch, and a BF16 tie in the target's logits then resolves the other way), so a difference between columns includes a change of text, not only of speed.

| Input | k=2 | k=3 | k=4 | k=5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Counting (2,048-token prompt) | 38.04 (2.92) | 42.24 (3.79) | 45.25 (4.68) | 45.60 (5.41) |
| Counting (short prompt) | 32.90 (2.50) | 27.82 (2.47) | 38.15 (3.93) | 36.09 (4.28) |
| Prose (2,048-token prompt) | 27.30 (2.00) | 25.15 (2.15) | 24.31 (2.38) | 20.23 (2.30) |
| Japanese prose, tuning / evaluation | 28.11 / 30.82 | 26.68 / 28.94 | 23.45 / 25.63 | 20.85 / 21.67 |
| Code (2,048-token prompt) | 33.16 (2.55) | 34.77 (3.15) | 34.85 (3.65) | 30.11 (3.66) |
| Code, tuning / evaluation | 34.37 / 35.26 | 36.60 / 36.19 | 35.44 / 35.59 | 33.34 / 32.23 |
| Tool round-trip, tuning / evaluation | 35.34 / 32.77 | 28.75 / 30.77 | 35.41 / 29.54 | 32.08 / 27.56 |
| Mean step time over the ten inputs (ms) | 74.8 | 88.2 | 101.1 | 117.3 |

The step time is linear in the depth (about 13.5 ms per draft depth on this pair: 7.4 ms of verification in the target's MoE for one more row, 6.1 ms of draft, most of it the BF16 `lm_head`). A depth pays only where the per-position acceptance holds up: counting keeps 0.84 at the fifth position, code 0.46, prose 0.08. So prose is fastest at k=2, code at k=3, counting at k=5, and the two columns in which k=3 loses most (the short counting prompt and the tuning tool input) are inputs whose k=3 completion is a different, longer-drafting text.

**Decision (2026-09-21):** one depth for both checkpoints, **k=3**. It is the best or within 8% of the best fixed depth on eight of the ten inputs, it is the template's depth, and holding two depths across two checkpoints was not worth its operating cost. The reference pair serves k=3 with the requantized checkpoint from this date ([serving profile](benchmarks.md#the-reference-pairs-serving-profile)). Operators whose workload is Japanese prose alone may set 2; counting-like generation gains from 4 or 5.

## Beyond a fixed depth (2026-09-21)

Everything below was measured on the reference pair on the same ten inputs, kept in private records, and is **not adopted**; none of it is in the code that ships.

- **Depth chosen from the request's own acceptance history** (a moving estimate of the per-position acceptance, depth raised or lowered between steps): 4 to 13% below the best fixed depth on every input, 4 to 6% below k=4 on code. Acceptance is two-humped on code and tool text (a step either passes all five drafts or fails at the first) and a running estimate cannot tell the humps apart.
- **A confidence gate on the draft** (stop drafting at the first depth whose top-1 probability is at or under a threshold; the draft's own probability predicts acceptance with AUC 0.89 at every depth): the mechanism works as designed, but every stop is a host synchronisation, and on two hosts under TP=2 each one costs about 1.3 ms in the next collectives while the ranks fall back into step, about 5 ms per step in all. That is the whole projected gain. vLLM's own proposals of the same rule ([#36657](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/36657), [#48202](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/48202)) were closed without a wall-clock gain either.
- **Not sharing the first depth's sparse top-k across draft depths** (`index_share_for_mtp_iteration = false`): acceptance equal or lower on every input, 2 to 3 ms per step slower. The checkpoint's setting is right.
- **Reducing the draft's logits on each rank instead of all-gathering them** (`use_local_argmax_reduction`): same completions and acceptance, same step time; the all-gather is 0.2 ms per depth.
- **Decode CUDA Graphs** on the full model: slower than eager on every input, with identical completions ([benchmarks](benchmarks.md#decode-graphs-on-the-full-model)).

Two facts from this work carry over to any later change on the draft side: a draft-side change that alters which candidates are drafted **alters the completions**, so it is judged by acceptance and teacher-forced NLL rather than by equal text; and the per-step cost of a depth is per row of verification and per draft forward, so any scheme that drafts fewer rows must also verify fewer rows to pay.
