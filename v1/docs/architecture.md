# Architecture

[日本語](architecture.ja.md)

The project is a checkout-local operator toolkit. Source archives contain no weights or remotely managed service. The optional LPA weights are a separate Release asset; [operations](operations.md#artifact-storage-and-paths) owns the package layout and installation paths.

## Where to start reading

Four kinds of code, distinguished by what a test can do with them rather than by any framework:

| | What it holds | Named seams |
|---|---|---|
| **Entry** | The argument interface, and which handler an action reaches | `server.ACTIONS`, `cluster.ACTIONS`, `__main__.COMMANDS` |
| **Assembly** | The order steps run in, and what a failure rolls back | `switch.switch`, `switch.resume`, `server.act_launch`, `cluster.act_switch` |
| **Decision** | Settings validated, arguments built, reports shaped — pure functions | `server_config.VALIDATORS`, `server_config.SERVE_STEPS`, `server_config.image_capability_checks`, `images.probe_verdict`, `validation.*.engine_kwargs`, `runtime.apc_policy`, `runtime.patch_*.patch_text` |
| **Side effect** | docker, HTTP, subprocess, torch, vLLM | `host.run`, `model_http`, the lazy GPU imports inside each runner |

The decision layer is where the numbers live that make one measurement comparable to the next, so it is the layer kept importable without torch or vLLM: `engine_kwargs(args)` states what a fixture runner launches under, on a host that cannot run it. `server_config` imports no side-effect module: the argv template and the site checks it needs are pure and live in it and in `fabric`, and a test reads its imports to keep `host` out. Entry and assembly take their side effects as arguments, so a test substitutes them; the side-effect layer is the substitution point, not the thing under test.

Order is part of the contract in two places. `VALIDATORS` runs the profile rules in a fixed sequence because the first raise is the sentence the operator reads. `SERVE_STEPS` writes into one argument list and later steps index into what earlier ones left.

| Location | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `glm53_setup/__main__.py` | Fixed command dispatch; no dynamic user-supplied module loading |
| `glm53_setup/config.py` | Checkout paths and validated pinned configuration |
| `glm53_setup/server.py`, `server_config.py`, `capacity.py`, `warmup.py`, `mojibake.py`, `agreement.py`, `prefix_gate.py` | Launch, supervision and the head client; categorized TOML settings and what is derived from them (the vLLM argument template, the image capability checks and warnings, the frozen launch manifest, dev mode); KV boot-line decomposition, the post-readiness request ladder, the Japanese/Korean broken-character check, the per-token agreement with a reference run (`server agreement`) and the cold/warm prefix-cache correctness gate (`server prefix-gate`) |
| `glm53_setup/host.py` | Host-side helpers shared by the launcher: fabric checks, snapshot resolution, memory samples, container inspection, subprocess execution |
| `glm53_setup/download.py`, `verify_download.py`, `images.py`, `build_reference.py` | Asset preparation (pinned download, checksum verification that waits for the downloader, base-image inspection and its pass rule, reference-image build) and guarded local operations |
| `glm53_setup/cluster.py`, `switch.py`, `launch_assets.py`, `fabric.py` | Pre-stop checks of every rank, owned switch/recovery transaction and its resume, read-only launch identities, and site validation, ring links and per-rank addressing, NCCL environment and RoCE rail checks ([launch contracts](launch-safety.md)) |
| `glm53_setup/tool_gate/` | The optional tool-argument gate on a loopback port in front of the model API: the schema check (`check`, decision), the one repair request (`repair`, assembly) and the HTTP relay with streaming (`proxy`, entry and side effects) |
| `glm53_setup/model_http.py`, `io.py` | Model-API-scoped HTTP transport that never follows redirects; durable local state helpers |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/pinned_patch.py`, `patch_*.py` | The source-pinned vLLM patches the image build applies: `pinned_patch` holds what they share (the hash gate on the pinned file, the `--package`/`--check` command, the record written beside the package); each `patch_*` module states its target, its pin and its anchors as a pure `patch_text(text)` that refuses a drifted or already patched source (`patch_kpool_ring` pins two files and uses the multi-file `prepare_files`/`main_files`; `patch_apc_lpa` and `patch_nope_reference` keep flags of their own) |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/reference_attention.py`, `patch_nope_reference.py`, `fa2_attention.py` | Candidate-preserving eager NoPE MLA reference, its source-pinned installation, and the FA2 path for calls of more than six rows (`runtime.fa2_attention`) |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/candidate_order.py` | Canonical logical candidate order at the shared sparse-MLA boundary ([candidate order](candidate-order.md)) |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/moe_token_order.py`, `patch_moe_order.py` | One token order inside each expert before the Marlin MoE kernel (`runtime.canonical_moe_order`) and its source-pinned patch |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/stable_topk.py`, `patch_indexer_topk.py` | The kpool indexer's top-k with ties settled (`runtime.stable_indexer_topk`) and its source-pinned patch |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/prefix_dedup.py`, `patch_prefix_dedup.py` | One cached prefix page per content (`runtime.prefix_page_dedup`) and its source-pinned patch |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/patch_slot_mapping.py` | Source-pinned patch: the slot-mapping kernel reads a block table only inside its row |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/patch_kpool_seed.py` | Source-pinned patch: the kpool prefill seed addresses tail blocks by the tail's strides (vLLM #57477) |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/patch_kpool_ring.py` | Source-pinned patch: the kpool raw-tail ring spans the speculative drafts, sized by the MTP depth (vLLM #58454); applies after `patch_kpool_seed` |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/patch_load_clone.py` | Source-pinned patch: each safetensors tensor is cloned off the checkpoint's file mapping before the loader copies it to the GPU |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/tp_padding.py` | The padded geometry for tensor-parallel sizes that do not divide the heads, MoE width and vocabulary, as pure functions of `GLM53_TP_PAD_MULTIPLE` (off when unset): 66 heads, width 2,112 and a vocabulary multiple of 192 at 3, and the zero-extension a loader applies before it takes a rank's shard |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/patch_tp_padding.py` | Source-pinned patch that installs that padding at load time in the text config, the column, row and sharded parameter loaders, the FusedMoE loaders and the vocabulary embedding, so the checkpoint stays as published; applies after `patch_load_clone` ([three nodes](server-configuration.md#three-nodes)) |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/patch_sampler_nonfinite.py` | Source-pinned patch: the Gumbel sampler, the rejection sampler's greedy stats and its resampling clamp a tile's argmax to the vocabulary, so a row of non-finite logits cannot emit an id past it (vLLM #50843, open upstream) |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/inductor_pin.py`, `inductor_pin_pth.txt` | Keeps Inductor's deterministic mode on through Dynamo's state restore, which turns it off after the first compiled frame (`runtime.inductor_deterministic`); the text file, mounted as `glm53-inductor-pin.pth` in the image's site directory, runs it at interpreter start |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/shm_spin.py`, `shm_spin_pth.txt` | Sets how long a shared-memory broadcast reader spins before it sleeps, vLLM's 1 s otherwise (`runtime.shm_spin_seconds`); the text file, mounted as `glm53-shm-spin.pth` in the image's site directory, runs it at interpreter start |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/lpa.py`, `lpa_query.py` | LPA worker control, attention-input approximation and request-scoped query omission |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/apc_policy.py`, `apc_runtime.py`, `apc_worker.py`, `patch_apc_lpa.py` | APC-first LPA admission, exact-only prefix publication and worker dispatch ([design contract](apc-lpa-design.md)) |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/fused_unpack.py` | Fused FP8 unpack kernel (LPA's eager-execution requirement lives in `lpa.py`) |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/indexer_capture.py`, `indexer_worker.py`, `component_worker.py` | CSA2 indexer observation and the exclusive component diagnostics worker ([indexer reuse](indexer-reuse.md)) |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/memory_probe.py` | The probe of a serving worker over dev `/collective_rpc`; `validation.memory_probe` loads it and mounts the checkout's copy over the image: `allocator_stats`, `host_stats`, `host_census`, `weight_digest`, `kernel_hashes`, `autotuners`, `inductor_state`, `fa2_stage`, `trace_begin`/`trace_end` ([server configuration](server-configuration.md#api-and-diagnostics)) |
| `glm53_setup/runtime/pipeline_state.py`, `patch_pipeline.py` | PP fixture transport and its source-pinned patch (P17) |
| `glm53_setup/validation/make_fixture.py`, `run_fixture.py`, `summarize_fixture.py`, `inspect_runtime.py`, `probe_attention.py`, `reference_check.py`, `parity.py` | Fixture build, run and assessment, in-container inspection, the NoPE dispatch probe, reference attention parity and the BF16 bound and verdicts the attention benchmarks share ([validation](validation.md)) |
| `glm53_setup/validation/run_agreement_fixture.py`, `compare_agreement.py`, `quant_error.py`, `run_repeat_trace.py` | Requantization checks on the fixture and the first module that differs between repeated passes ([validation](validation.md#repeatability)) |

| `glm53_setup/validation/run_lpa.py`, `lpa_corpus.py`, `train_lpa.py` | LPA fixture verification, corpus preparation and projector fitting |
| `glm53_setup/validation/freedombench.py`, `freedom_scoring.py`, `apc_history.py`, `profile_trace.py`, `benchmark_*.py` | FreedomBench runner and scoring, APC history regression, trace event accounting and component benchmarks |
| `glm53_setup/validation/hle.py`, `hle_scoring.py` | HLE runner (a pinned question file, one question at a time, resumable) and CPU-portable answer extraction; the exact-match rule is kept for the off-host grader |
| `glm53_setup/validation/kpool_ring_repro.py` | GPU repro of the kpool tail ring on the reference image: a rejected pool-completing draft against the prefill writer, with a one-pool ring and the MTP-3 ring ([validation](validation.md#kpool-tail-ring-repro)) |
| `glm53_setup/validation/fused_nope.py`, `fused_nope_dot.py`, `indexer_candidates.py`, `indexer_reindex.py`, `indexer_shared_pool.py` | Retired prototypes kept for reproduction and reached only from their benchmarks and tests: fused NoPE attention ([component validation](component-validation.md)) and indexer candidate reuse ([indexer reuse](indexer-reuse.md)) |
| `config/` | Model/image pins and `lpa-projector.lock.json` (Release URL, checksum, teacher and training provenance); no credentials or measured site configuration |
| `examples/` | The two server profiles, `server.example.toml` (the distributed defaults) and `server.axl.example.toml` (the published option), with illustrative values only; `server.tp3.example.toml` (the defaults on a three-node ring, TP=3, with illustrative links); and the MTP speculative templates |
| `examples/zcode-hooks/` | ZCode existing-file guard hook and its setup ([harnesses](harnesses.md)) |
| `overlays/` | The two vLLM source overlays that the published option's checkpoint needs, with their manifest ([overlays/README.md](../overlays/README.md)) |

| `LICENSES/` | Preserved upstream license texts |
| `state/`, `records/` | Local mutable state and experiment evidence, excluded from distribution |

The CLI imports GPU dependencies only when the selected command actually needs them. Help, configuration and CPU tests work without Torch or vLLM installed on the host. GPU programs execute inside the pinned image.

The commented `examples/server.example.toml` doubles as the complete server profile schema. Full TOML validation happens at `server_config.load` and the independently callable `server.command` boundary. `server_config.serve_args` consumes an already validated profile and does not reread the schema; it is an internal assembly step, not an input-validation entry point. Small fabric-specific guards remain independent.

Model ID and revision have one configuration source: [runtime.lock.json](../config/runtime.lock.json). Mutable files stay rooted at the checkout, independently of the caller's working directory. Run the toolkit from a maintained checkout; it is not offered as a general Python library.

Every build-time patch of the reference image checks the full SHA-256 of the pinned vLLM file it modifies before changing it, and the overlays for the published option are checked the same way at launch. The image keeps all selected attention candidates. The runtime math and the validation harness are separate modules so moving CLI code does not change the mathematical implementation.

## Where a module belongs

**Worker extensions.** `runtime/` holds the worker classes a serving launch loads. `server_config.apply_worker_extension` names `lpa.LPAWorkerExtension`, `component_worker.ComponentWorker` and `memory_probe.MemoryProbeWorker`; `ComponentWorker` subclasses `indexer_worker.IndexerCaptureWorker`, which `run_indexer_fixture` also loads on its own. `validation/` holds the workers only a fixture runner loads: `apc_fixture_worker` and `pipeline_worker`. `expert_worker` is the exception: serving loads it for the EP observer launch (`validation.expert_worker`), and it stays in `validation/` because it subclasses `validation.pipeline_worker.PipelineFixtureWorker`. Retired prototypes that only their benchmarks and tests import also live in `validation/`.

**Commands.** Most validation runners are subcommands of `python -m glm53_setup` (`__main__.COMMANDS`). These run only as `python -m glm53_setup.validation.<module>`: every `benchmark_*` except `benchmark_apc_lpa` (registered as `apc-lpa-benchmark`), `run_components`, `run_graph_fixture`, `run_indexer_fixture` and `run_repeat_trace`. `indexer-overlap` is registered although it fits that group: it is the CPU comparison of the candidate rows `runtime/indexer_capture.py` records, which `run_indexer_fixture` drives.

## Validation boundaries

Download completion, checksum success, GPU smoke, config interpretation, attention parity, fixture integration and full-model qualification at each TP size are different evidence types. A result from one level cannot substitute for another. In particular, the one-GPU fixture cannot stand in for multi-rank evidence, and TP=2 evidence does not stand in for TP=3.
