# NCCL diagnostics

[日本語](nccl-validation.ja.md) · [Network preparation](qsfp-network.md) · [Validation limits](validation.md)

The repository supplies a small [PyTorch/NCCL probe](../tools/nccl_probe.py). It checks two or three ranks (`--world-size`, default 2) with rank-dependent patterns: FP32/BF16 AllReduce at 1 KiB, 1 MiB, 16 MiB and 256 MiB per rank, plus FP32 AllGather, ReduceScatter and Broadcast. It does not load model weights or generate a full-model qualification receipt.

## Run on two hosts

First verify fixed IPv4, HCA, RoCEv2 GID and peer routing. Inventory **host processes and active transfers**, not only Docker containers. Pause or wait for authorized competing work before claiming isolated bandwidth. Never stop an unrelated transfer automatically.

Use the same reviewed source and pinned base image on both hosts. Select fresh container names and output directories. In each host's Linux checkout, replace these illustrative values with observations (rank 1 uses its own interface/HCA/IP; `HEAD_IP` remains rank 0's address):

```sh
RANK=0
FABRIC_IF='REPLACE_WITH_OBSERVED_INTERFACE'
HCA='REPLACE_WITH_OBSERVED_HCA'
GID='REPLACE_WITH_OBSERVED_INDEX'
HEAD_IP='10.53.0.1'
RUN_ID='REPLACE_WITH_UNIQUE_RUN_ID'
IMAGE=$(python -c 'from glm53_setup.config import load_lock; print(load_lock()["image"])')
mkdir -p "records/$RUN_ID"
```

Confirm port 29653 is unused on rank 0. Start rank 1 and then rank 0 promptly (rendezvous timeout is 90 seconds). Keep an external five-minute experiment deadline; if exceeded, stop these specific test containers on both hosts and preserve their logs.

```sh
docker run --name "glm53-nccl-$RUN_ID-rank$RANK" \
  --gpus all --network host --memory 16g --memory-swap 16g --shm-size 1g \
  --cap-add IPC_LOCK --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 \
  --device /dev/infiniband:/dev/infiniband \
  -e NCCL_NET=IB -e NCCL_IB_DISABLE=0 \
  -e "NCCL_IB_HCA==$HCA" -e "NCCL_IB_GID_INDEX=$GID" \
  -e NCCL_IB_ROCE_VERSION_NUM=2 -e NCCL_IB_ADDR_FAMILY=AF_INET \
  -e NCCL_SOCKET_FAMILY=AF_INET -e "NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME==$FABRIC_IF" \
  -e "GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME=$FABRIC_IF" \
  -e NCCL_DEBUG=INFO -e NCCL_DEBUG_SUBSYS=INIT,NET,GRAPH \
  -v "$PWD/tools/nccl_probe.py:/probe.py:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/records/$RUN_ID:/out" \
  --entrypoint python3 "$IMAGE" /probe.py \
  --rank "$RANK" --head "$HEAD_IP" --port 29653 \
  --output "/out/rank$RANK.json" >"records/$RUN_ID/nccl.log" 2>&1
```

The doubled equals signs in the Docker arguments are intentional: the environment value begins with `=` for an exact device-name match. See [NCCL's environment reference](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/env.html). Keep the distributed ports within the trusted fabric.

## Accept and interpret

- Both processes must exit zero, both JSON reports must contain all 11 passing checks, and neither container may be OOM-killed.
- Inspect both transport logs: `Using network IB` and the intended HCA/RoCE and bootstrap interface must be present. A successful TCP rendezvous alone does not demonstrate the collective transport.
- Save the actual image ID and source revision. The NCCL runtime version printed during communicator initialization can differ from `torch.cuda.nccl.version()`; the report labels the latter `torch_reported_nccl` and records mapped libraries.
- Timings are ten-operation averages after warmup and include Python dispatch and synchronization. `payload_GB_per_s` is per-rank payload bytes divided by elapsed seconds, using decimal GB. It is not aggregate link bandwidth, an official `nccl-tests` result or model throughput.
- Record concurrent jobs and the MTU. No production bandwidth threshold is established by this probe. Repeat only when a changed condition or unresolved measurement concern warrants it.

DGX Spark's unified-memory platform does not support conventional GPUDirect RDMA via `nvidia-peermem`, DMA-BUF or GDRCopy according to [NVIDIA's porting guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/dgx-spark-porting-guide/porting/cuda.html). Therefore `NET/IB` with `GDR 0` is not by itself a failed RoCE test. Do not load a kernel module or force GDR merely to change that log field.

Reference result (two GB10 hosts, MTU 1500, NCCL runtime 2.30.7, after fabric transfers had ended): both ranks passed all 11 checks and all containers exited zero without OOM; 256 MiB AllReduce measured 1.18–1.21 GB/s with an unrelated disk-checksum job still active, so this is not an idle-host benchmark. A separate `NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=SYS` comparison also passed without enabling GDR or adding bandwidth, and is not part of the command above.

## Three hosts in a ring

On a ring ([network](qsfp-network.md#8-three-hosts-in-a-ring)), run the probe once on all three hosts with `--world-size 3`, the fabric environment of the launch and the head's address as `--head`, starting ranks 2 and 1 before rank 0. Then probe each link alone with `--world-size 2`: `server plan` prints each rank's links under `link_probes`, each with the pair's head, the probe rank and an environment that names only that link. With three or more nodes the launcher sets `NCCL_IB_SUBNET_AWARE_ROUTING=1`, so NCCL sends to each peer over the link whose subnet reaches it.

Accept as above on every rank. Reference result (three GB10 hosts, NCCL runtime 2.30.7, 2026-09-29): all 11 checks passed on three ranks; NCCL merged each host's two HCAs into one virtual NIC, built the ring 0→1→2 and ran every channel over `NET/IB`, with no fallback to sockets. AllReduce bus bandwidth was 7.87 GB/s at 16 MiB and 7.01 GB/s at 256 MiB in FP32, 8.56 and 6.94 GB/s in BF16; these are bus bandwidths, not the probe's per-rank `payload_GB_per_s`. GPUDirect RDMA stayed off, as on the pair.

## A GID index that moves

`server preflight` refuses a rail whose IPv4-mapped RoCE v2 GID is not at the configured index, and lists under `gid_hints` where that entry is now, with `fixes`. A link that goes down and comes back can move it: MiaAI-Lab recipe #277 reports this, and the reference pair's peer moved rail 0 from index 3 to 4 on 2026-09-27 after the head lost power. A second IPv6 link-local address on the interface moves it too: NetworkManager's default `ipv6.addr-gen-mode` of `stable-privacy` adds one beside the kernel's, its GID entries come first, and the IPv4 entries shift to later indices (MiaAI-Lab recipe #291 reports 5 and 6 instead of 2 and 3). On a node with two rails, each HCA can then end at a different index, while NCCL takes one per rank. `gid_hints` names this `likely_cause: nm_stable_privacy` when the rail's net device carries two distinct link-local GIDs and the IPv4 RoCE v2 entry is at another index; with one link-local it names no cause.

To confirm, `ip -o addr show dev <interface>` lists two `inet6 fe80::` addresses, and `nmcli -g ipv6.addr-gen-mode connection show <connection>` shows a mode other than `eui64`. The recipe's fixes, both as root: set the connection's `ipv6.addr-gen-mode` to `eui64` and reactivate it, or rebind the HCA's `mlx5_core` PCI function so its GID table is rebuilt. After a link drop, set that node's `gid_index` when all its rails agree, or restore the index on the host (reboot, or bring the interface down and up, as root). The check keeps refusing until the entry is back at the configured index. Neither fix has been needed on the reference hosts.

## Channel count

On its own, NCCL 2.30.7 opens 64 channels on this pair (identical on 2026-09-11 and 2026-09-17). The template sets [`runtime.nccl_channels = 8`](server-configuration.md). The measurements behind that value were taken on 2026-09-17 with the reference image and the launcher's fabric environment, changing only `NCCL_MIN_NCHANNELS`/`NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS`.

**Collectives alone.** A two-rank BF16 AllReduce sweep, run twice in opposite orders, took the median of seven batches per size. Memory is the drop in `MemAvailable` across communicator setup and all sizes. The sizes the model uses are set by hidden size 4096 in BF16 (8,192 bytes per token): a decode verify with MTP k=3 is 32 KiB, a draft step 8 KiB, and a 512-token prefill chunk 4 MiB.

| Channels | Memory per rank | 32 KiB | 4 MiB | 256 MiB |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 64 (NCCL's choice) | 2.3 GiB | 0.022 ms | 0.41–0.45 ms | 20.0 ms (MTU 9000), 26.1 ms (MTU 1500) |
| 32 | 1.5 GiB | 0.022 ms | 0.35–0.39 ms | 19.7–23.5 ms |
| 16 | 1.0 GiB | 0.022 ms | 0.34–0.35 ms | 19.7–20.6 ms |
| 8 | 0.85 GiB | 0.022 ms | 0.33–0.36 ms | 19.4–19.5 ms |
| 4 | 0.75 GiB | 0.022 ms | 0.35–0.37 ms | 19.4 ms |

Decode-sized messages do not change, because NCCL already uses fewer channels for small messages. The memory does not depend on MTU. These timings are not comparable with the probe run above, which measured FP32 while another job contended for the host.

**Full model.** The same profile was started with only the channel count or the MTU changed. All runs followed one reboot. The monitoring dashboard on the head was stopped for the MTU 9000 runs and left running for the MTU 1500 runs (65 MiB and about 2% CPU on the head, plus metric commands on the peer), so the two MTUs differ in that load as well; the two channel counts at one MTU do not. Prefill is the median of three fresh 38,961-token prompts. The lowest free memory is read from each rank's supervisor samples during startup, warmup and the measurement.

| MTU | Channels | Prefill tok/s | Head lowest free | Peer lowest free |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1500 | 64 | 487.3 | 4.18 GiB | 6.48 GiB |
| 1500 | **8** | **492.0** | **6.93 GiB** | **9.43 GiB** |
| 9000 | 64 | 499.8 | 2.94 GiB | 4.76 GiB |
| 9000 | 8 | 503.2 | 5.81 GiB | 8.08 GiB |
| 9000 | 16 | 497.3 | 5.39 GiB | 7.57 GiB |

Each engine opens two communicators, so 8 channels return about 3 GiB per rank; prefill is within 1% either way. Decode varied more between runs of one setting (about ±15%) than between settings.

**MTU.** 9000 (RoCE active MTU 4096) raised prefill by at most 2.3–2.6%, an upper bound because only the MTU 1500 runs carried the dashboard, and lowered free memory by 1.1–1.7 GiB per host. An idle host without the model showed the same 1.4 GiB, which fits larger NIC receive buffers (four interfaces × 20 queues × 1,024 descriptors). The reference pair stays at MTU 1500. A prefill figure taken before the reboot (446 tok/s at MTU 1500) was lower from host state, not MTU, and is left out of the table.
