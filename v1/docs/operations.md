# Operations

[日本語](operations.ja.md)

What is accepted for routine use, and where each item's evidence lives, is recorded in [SETUP step 6](../SETUP.md#6-qualify-the-full-model); this page describes how the launcher runs.

## One launcher

The checkout has one launch path: `python -m glm53_setup server …`, driven by [one server TOML](server-configuration.md) and wrapped by the [switch and recovery procedure](launch-safety.md#all-rail-checks-and-two-rank-switch) when a launch is already running. Every full-model measurement in this repository ran through it, and the [launch checks](#full-model-launch-checks) below are the checks it performs before a start.

## Artifact storage and paths

This section owns deployment storage paths. The model ID, revision and base-image digest are fixed by [runtime.lock.json](../config/runtime.lock.json). The base checkpoint is acquired upstream; the optional LPA projector is distributed as a separate GitHub Release asset. Keep operator-specific hostnames, absolute home paths and credentials outside the public source.

| Artifact | Default location on each Linux host | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Base checkpoint | `$HOME/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--nvidia--GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4/snapshots/<revision>/` | Fixed model/config/tokenizer view. Weight files link into the sibling `blobs/` directory, which holds their data |
| MTP metadata view, required by distributed defaults | `$HOME/.cache/huggingface/local-views/glm53-mtp-compatible/<revision>/` | Links existing tensor data and adjusts quantization metadata for the checkpoint's BF16 MTP; [create the view](speculative-decoding.md#prepare-a-view-on-each-linux-host) without editing the original snapshot |
| LPA projector, required when `lpa.enabled = true` (off in the template) | `<checkout>/state/lpa/glm53-lpa-cut32-v1/projector.pt`; selected by `[lpa].projector` relative to the [server TOML](server-configuration.md) or absolute | Separate Release asset, outside the NVIDIA snapshot and source archive. [Download and verify](lpa.md#download-the-trained-projector) on every host, or train a matching projector; [enabling](lpa.md#enable-lpa-in-the-server-profile) is a separate profile edit and switch. Plain inference and batching do not require it |
| Docker base/reference images | Docker-managed storage | Pull the fixed base and build the reference image from this source. Source checkout, image and checkpoint are separate artifacts |
| Local configuration and acquisition state | `<checkout>/state/` | The server TOML and `download-status.json`; the latter records the actual acquired `snapshot` path |
| Runtime/JIT cache and evidence | `<checkout>/state/tp2-runtime-cache/` (`tp3-runtime-cache/` for [three nodes](#three-nodes)), `<checkout>/records/` | Regenerable runtime data and private execution records; not model weights or distribution inputs. Distributed startup points the Triton, TileLang and TorchInductor caches and the CUDA driver's JIT cache (`CUDA_CACHE_PATH=/root/.cache/nv`, otherwise `~/.nv/ComputeCache` inside the container) into the runtime cache so compiled kernels survive restarts; the [warmup ladder](#warmup-ladder) records what still compiles |

The LPA asset expands as follows. `manifest.json` is a copy of the [projector lock](../config/lpa-projector.lock.json); source checkout archives do not include this directory.

```

A source archive also omits `state/` and `records/` by design. A host deployment must create symlinks from the new checkout to its persistent runtime directories before using the server launcher:

```sh
ln -sT /srv/glm53/state /srv/glm53/source/state
ln -sT /srv/glm53/records /srv/glm53/source/records
readlink -f /srv/glm53/source/state /srv/glm53/source/records
```

Use absolute host paths; `-T` makes `ln` fail instead of nesting `state/state` inside an existing directory, and `readlink -f` must print `/srv/glm53/state` and `/srv/glm53/records`, not paths ending in `state/state` or `records/records`. Retain the old checkout for recovery, and never place credentials or raw records in the source archive.

The server launcher reads the default host Hugging Face cache and mounts it read-only at `/hf` in the container. It resolves the selected snapshot or MTP view within that mount. Preserve the entire model cache's `blobs`/`snapshots` relationship; copying a snapshot directory alone is insufficient. Every host needs the complete checkpoint on disk; TP partitions loaded tensors, not the downloaded files.

The downloader follows Hugging Face cache environment settings, but the current launcher assumes the default cache root. For this release, leave `HF_HOME`/`HF_HUB_CACHE` unset when acquiring these assets and use the documented default. A successful custom-cache download does not establish that the launcher can find or mount it.

Inspect the expected and recorded locations without starting a download, from the checkout on each Linux host:

```sh
python -c 'from pathlib import Path; from glm53_setup.config import MODEL, REVISION; print(Path.home() / ".cache/huggingface/hub" / ("models--" + MODEL.replace("/", "--")) / "snapshots" / REVISION)'
python -c 'import json; from glm53_setup.config import STATE; s = json.loads((STATE / "download-status.json").read_text()); print(s.get("status"), s.get("snapshot", "not recorded"))'
```

The second command requires prior acquisition registration in this checkout. Neither printed path nor `status=complete` substitutes for checksum verification. Server settings must reference the image actually built and inspected on every host.

## Acquire and verify once

Use the pinned revision from `config/runtime.lock.json`. `download` reuses Hugging Face cache files and prevents overlapping downloads in the same checkout. `verify-download` runs the official checksum verifier, which may contact Hugging Face for metadata. Offline inference is distinct from offline checksum verification.

For a second host, transfer the model's complete `blobs` and `snapshots` trees together. A snapshot contains links into `blobs`; copying or mounting only the snapshot can break those links. Preserve existing cache files and avoid delete-sync options.

After the transfer, run `download` once to register and check the fixed snapshot in that checkout. Matching cached files are reused; missing files may be fetched. Then run `verify-download` without `--wait`. Do not claim transfer success solely from file sizes.

Hashing 200 GB fills the page cache, which shares unified memory with the GPU. Another two-Spark recipe reports two power losses in nine checksum passes on idle GPUs (tonyd2wild PR #19, no code adopted); verify before loading a model rather than beside a serving pair. Large reads on a serving host have the same effect on a smaller scale: exporting the 9.7 GiB reference image from the peer rank took its MemFree from 3.0 to 0.87 GiB while MemAvailable stayed above 8.8 GiB. NVIDIA's later checkpoint revision `09b04e5e` (2026-09-11) differs from the pinned revision only in `README.md`.

## Prepare each host

1. Inspect available memory, disk, GPU/driver, active model processes and host state. Stop another model through its own documented procedure before an eventual GLM launch.
2. Run `prepare-image` on each host. It pulls the pinned ARM64 base and records actual package versions, GPU calculation and GLM registration. The base's native NoPE path is not a qualified serving path.
3. Build the reference image once with `build-reference`. Its base digest comes from the lock. To replicate it, use Docker image save/load over the verified local link and compare actual image IDs.
4. Run the [single-GPU validation](validation.md). Keep the image, precision, source hashes and generated records together.

Docker's overlay2 storage cannot load an image of more than about 125 layers: `docker load` on the receiving host fails with `max depth exceeded` (MiaAI-Lab recipe #301–#304, whose image had reached 126). `build-reference` writes the built image's layer count (`RootFS.Layers`), that limit and the headroom to `image-layers.json` in its record, and warns above 123 layers, the budget that recipe's test enforces.

## Host kernel and multi-node RoCE

**Check the kernel and the driver before installing updates and before the multi-host steps.** The measurements in this repository ran on `6.17.0-1032-nvidia` with driver 580.173.02 and ConnectX-7 firmware 28.45.4028 on MSI EdgeXpert (MS-C931). Kernel `7.0.0-1019-nvidia` and driver 580.178.04 are not validated here.

Updates available as of 2026-09-15 move the `linux-nvidia-hwe-24.04` metapackages to `7.0.0-1019-nvidia`, with the 580 open driver modules built for it. The same update moves `nvidia-driver-580-open` from 580.173.02 to 580.178.04 (seen in `apt list --upgradable` on both reference hosts, 2026-09-18). An `apt` upgrade or a DGX Dashboard update installs it, so a newly installed system boots it after its first update.

With that kernel's defaults, two-host NCCL over RoCE can fail with `NCCL WARN Call to ibv_reg_mr_iova2 failed with error Cannot allocate memory`. Reports describe the model loading and then failing during vLLM profiling or tensor-parallel communication, while raw RDMA tests such as `ib_write_bw` look healthy. NVIDIA's [update advisory](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/dgx-spark-update-advisory/383254) (2026-09-13) recommends that multi-node/RoCE users hold off on this kernel, including updates through DGX Dashboard, and names no fixed release. Whether single-host workloads are affected is not established.

The analysis in [NV-Kernels PR #590](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NV-Kernels/pull/590) (open; a contributor's analysis, not an NVIDIA statement) traces the failure to Kexec HandOver (KHO). The `7.0.0-1019-nvidia` build sets `CONFIG_KEXEC_HANDOVER_ENABLE_DEFAULT=y` (checked in its package config; `6.17.0-1032-nvidia` does not enable KHO by default). At boot, KHO reserves scratch memory for a later kexec and releases it as CMA pageblocks, about 9.3 GiB (4,761 pageblocks) in that report, without counting them in `CmaTotal`. RDMA memory registration pins pages long-term, and pinned pages must first move out of CMA; under GPU memory pressure that migration fails and registration returns `ENOMEM`.

Configure every host the same way:

| Choice | Steps | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Keep `6.17.0-1032-nvidia` | Before upgrading: `sudo apt-mark hold linux-nvidia-hwe-24.04 linux-image-nvidia-hwe-24.04 linux-headers-nvidia-hwe-24.04 linux-modules-nvidia-580-open-nvidia-hwe-24.04 linux-tools-nvidia-hwe-24.04 nvidia-driver-580-open`. Afterwards `apt-mark showhold` must list all six. If 7.0 is already installed, the previous kernel stays installed; boot it from the GRUB menu's advanced options (console access required). | The validated state of this repository. Release the holds when a fixed kernel is published. |
| Run `7.0.0-1019-nvidia` with KHO off | Add `kho=off` to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` in `/etc/default/grub`, keeping the existing values. Run `sudo update-grub` and reboot. Confirm `kho=off` in `/proc/cmdline`; `sudo ls /sys/kernel/debug/kho` must fail with "No such file or directory". | Posted in the advisory thread. The PR reports two-host registration, NCCL and TP2 workload tests passing with KHO off. Not yet validated by this repository. KHO serves kexec-based live update, which this deployment does not use. This row also accepts driver 580.178.04, and `kho=off` does nothing for the host freeze described below. |

**The same update carries a report of a second failure, unrelated to RoCE.** Another two-Spark recipe reports both hosts freezing under ordinary serving load within about 24 hours of the DGX OS 7.5.0 → 7.6.0 update (kernel `7.0.0-1019-nvidia`, driver 580.178.04, Docker 29.6.2) (amasu, forum-post draft in commit `030d37e`; no code adopted). Over two days and two serving stacks it happened five or more times: ping still answered, sshd did not, and only a power cycle recovered the host. The kernel log before each freeze shows bursts of `NVRM: nvCheckOkFailedNoLog: Check failed: Out of memory [NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY] ... returned from _memdescAlloc` (65 and 148 in one boot), with MemAvailable at 9.4 GB and about 73% of swap free, and no OOM-killer event, Xid or panic. The same hosts are described as stable for weeks on 7.5.0 with 580.173.02. The report also notes that the 7.6.0 release notes name 580.173.02 as the Spark driver and that the 580.178.04 support matrix does not list GB10. It is a draft whose hardware-diagnostic results are not filled in; what it shows is correlation, not an established cause. KHO explains the failed RDMA registration and does not explain this freeze. Hold the driver as well, and if the symptom appears after an update, check the previous boot with `journalctl -b -1 -k | grep -c _memdescAlloc`.

After either choice, repeat the [NCCL validation](nccl-validation.md) and a full-model launch before serving.

A separate report with the same error, on MS-C931 systems running an Ubuntu generic 7.0 kernel with driver 595.84, failed with about 118 GiB free before weights loaded and attributes the fix to MSI board firmware updates (embedded controller, SoC firmware, USB-C PD) ([MiaAI-Lab issue #259](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/DeepSeek-v4-Flash-DSpark-2x-DGX-Spark/issues/259)). If the error appears without memory pressure, check the vendor firmware as well.

**Check loaded clocks after an unclean restart.** tonyd2wild reports a persistent ~14 W clamp after watchdog resets: 611–890 MHz under load, with BF16 matrix throughput about half the unaffected host. GPU reset, clock/power settings and reboots did not restore it; disconnecting and reconnecting AC did. Running CUDA immediately after a GPU reset without a reboot also faulted (speed-night report, commit `9f5cc2c`; no code adopted). This is an external observation, not reproduced on this reference pair. Before attributing a post-restart slowdown to a model change, record GPU clocks and power under the same workload; an idle power reading alone does not diagnose the clamp.

## Network and site configuration

For physical connection and persistent IPv4 configuration, use the [QSFP hands-on guide](qsfp-network.md).

Record each host's measured values in the `[nodes]` section of the [server TOML](server-configuration.md), which is the same file on every host:

- fabric IPv4 (the head's is that of the first node), Ethernet interface, RDMA HCA and that interface's RoCEv2 GID index;
- on a ring of three, one `links` entry per other node instead, and each host's `host_address` and `host_interface` ([three nodes](server-configuration.md#three-nodes));
- unused API and rendezvous ports in `[api]`.

The HCA and GID number need not match between hosts. Confirm the GID maps to the local IPv4 and net device. Use MTU 9000 only when both endpoints and the whole path support it. Verify the actual NCCL transport and collective correctness before loading the full model; a successful SSH connection is not an RDMA test. `server plan` and `server preflight` then check these values ([launch checks](#full-model-launch-checks)).

## Full-model launch checks

`server preflight --rank N` checks, on each host, the pinned snapshot and MTP view, the fabric settings, the selected image ID and its capability markers, the projector checksum when LPA is enabled, that no other container holds the GPU, and the available memory; `server start` runs the same checks and refuses to start on a failure; when they pass, it saves them with the settings and the container command under `records/<timestamp>-server-r<N>/`. `server plan` prints that command without starting anything, and `preflight` prints its checks as JSON and exits nonzero if any fails. `cluster switch` repeats them on every rank before stopping the running launch and again before starting the new one.

`server preflight` also checks the image's capability markers: each enabled feature must find its marker in the image environment, as listed in the [image contract](server-configuration.md#current-image-contract). One marker has a recovery exception. With `runtime.canonical_moe_order = true`, a new launch requires `GLM53_MOE_ORDER_API=2`. Marker 1 is also carried by an earlier image whose token sort mis-sized its buffer, so a profile that points at a marker-1 image fails `moe_order_support` in `server preflight`, `server start` and the pre-stop checks of `cluster switch`; rebuild the reference image and update `reference_image`. A pair that is already serving from a marker-1 image is not stranded: the switch checks it, and restarts it if the new pair fails, as a recovery target that keeps marker 1, and records `moe_order_marker_1_accepted_for_recovery` under the rank's `warnings`. To run the same read-only check by hand against the profile of a running marker-1 pair, add `--recovery` to `server preflight`; the flag belongs to the coordinator's restore path and is not a way to launch an old image anew.

Four build patches fix upstream vLLM bugs and are removed when the pinned vLLM moves past the upstream fix; a fifth works around slow weight loading on this hardware. Each is checked against the source's SHA-256 like the other build patches, and no check requires their markers.

- `GLM53_SLOT_MAPPING_GUARD=1` (images built from 1.7.0; `glm53_setup/runtime/patch_slot_mapping.py`, vLLM issue #53982): the slot-mapping kernel reads a block table only inside its row. Without it the published option faults on requests above about 250K tokens ([measurement](benchmarks.md#the-reference-pairs-serving-profile)). No check requires the marker, so an older image still launches.
- `GLM53_KPOOL_SEED_STRIDE=1` (images built from 1.13.0; `glm53_setup/runtime/patch_kpool_seed.py`, the same change as vLLM pull request #57477): the kpool prefill seed kernel addresses the indexer's raw-tail blocks by the tail's own strides. Without it every prefill leaves the request's own tail block unseeded and writes the last tokens' key and gate into a low-numbered indexer block, which can belong to another request; the damage is to sparse top-k selection over long contexts, most of all a long prompt reused from the prefix cache. On the reference pair no measured output changed with the patch ([measurements](benchmarks.md#measurements-on-1130)). No check requires the marker.
- `GLM53_KPOOL_RING=1` (images built from 1.19.0; `glm53_setup/runtime/patch_kpool_ring.py`, the same change as vLLM pull request #58454): the indexer's raw-tail ring holds `kpool * next_power_of_2(ceil((kpool + k) / kpool))` slots for MTP depth k instead of one pool: 4 without MTP (unchanged), 8 for k = 1 to 4, 16 for k = 5. Without it, with k of 2 or more, a rejected draft that completes a pool is redone from keys that the drafts behind it have already overwritten, and the indexer cache receives a wrong compressed key; the damage is to sparse top-k selection over pools built during decode once the context passes `index_topk` (2,048 tokens), whether the length comes from the prompt or the output. The patch applies to the kernel file only after `patch_kpool_seed` (its pinned hash is the seed patch's output). Upstream calls it a partial fix, with more changes expected. The kernel repro is in [validation](validation.md#kpool-tail-ring-repro); on a GB10 on 2026-09-26 the one-pool ring differed from the no-speculation reference after a rejected draft and the eight-slot ring matched it, and upstream's kernel tests passed (33, one skipped). On the reference pair (MTP k=3) the tail group became 8 slots (`kv cache group sizes [4608, 8, 4608, 4608, 4608]`) and all three decode checks, whose 2,048-token prompts put every decode-built pool past `index_topk`, changed their completions while still repeating bit for bit ([measurements](benchmarks.md#measurements-on-1190)). No check requires the marker, so an older image still passes `cluster switch`.
- `GLM53_SAMPLER_VOCAB_BOUND=1` (images built from 1.25.0; `glm53_setup/runtime/patch_sampler_nonfinite.py`, vLLM pull request #50843, open upstream): the Gumbel sampler, the rejection sampler's greedy stats and its resampling clamp a tile's argmax to the vocabulary. Without it a row whose last tile holds only non-finite logits can emit an id past the vocabulary, which the embedding reads as zeros; under MTP the rejection sampler runs at temperature 0 too. No check requires the marker.
- `GLM53_LOAD_CLONE=1` (images built from 1.19.0; `glm53_setup/runtime/patch_load_clone.py`): the default safetensors iterator clones each tensor into anonymous memory before the loader copies it to the GPU. With a CUDA context on GB10, a copy from the checkpoint's file mapping ran at about 0.16 GiB/s and the cloned copy at about 1.55 GiB/s (one GB10, 3 GiB of a shard per run, 2026-09-26); rank 0 of the reference pair had spent 532 s loading weights on 1.18.0. The clone holds one tensor at a time. vLLM's `--safetensors-load-strategy eager` is not an alternative on this kit: it keeps a whole shard twice while loading (22.81 GiB peak for an 11.15 GiB shard) and, tried on the reference pair on 2026-09-26, it ran a rank out of memory and the host stopped answering for about 15 minutes. `enable_multithread_load` holds whole shards the same way, and `prefetch` does not help: the slow copy is from file-backed pages even when they are cached. No check requires the marker.

`exclusive_gpu` fails while a running container requests a GPU without this launcher's `glm53.experiment.startup` label, and the result lists those containers under `foreign_gpu_containers`. A container requests a GPU when `HostConfig.DeviceRequests` is non-empty: both `--gpus` and CDI (`--device nvidia.com/gpu=...`) requests appear there, while the GPU device nodes never appear under `Devices`. A pair of this launcher carries the label whatever its fingerprint, so a running old pair does not block the pre-stop checks of `cluster switch`; an empty label value does not count. A container that exits or is removed while the check runs is skipped, and one still listed that cannot be inspected makes the check raise instead of passing. Stop other GPU workloads, such as a component probe or another model, before a start; there is no override. `server assets` runs the same check without the memory reading. Informed by sfxnz PR #12 (no code adopted).

A passing preflight certifies assets and configuration, not quality or availability: the acceptance items for routine use and where their evidence is recorded are listed in [the setup runbook](../SETUP.md#6-qualify-the-full-model), and the current status per scope is in the README status table. Do not relax a failing check, truncate attention candidates or silently substitute precision to get past it.

The workers start headless first and the head last, once they wait for rendezvous ([launch order](launch-safety.md#three-nodes)). The API binds to the head's loopback address; use an SSH tunnel for a remote client. Internal rendezvous uses the fabric IP. Exposing it as a business service requires a separately reviewed authentication/TLS/access-control layer; this repository does not claim to supply one.

## Three nodes

A profile with three `[[nodes]]` runs TP=3 on a QSFP ring. The cabling, addressing and the single-host reboot check are in [QSFP network](qsfp-network.md#8-three-hosts-in-a-ring), the settings in [server configuration](server-configuration.md#three-nodes), and launch order, the switch's refusal of a rank-count change and the per-host runtime cache in [launch contracts](launch-safety.md#three-nodes). The ring's runtime caches live in `state/tp3-runtime-cache/` on each host ([storage](#artifact-storage-and-paths)).

A derived checkpoint (the published option) and its overlays must be present on every host at the paths the profile names; `server preflight` checks them on each rank. At 22 heads per rank only the current KDA overlay loads ([overlays](../overlays/README.md)).

Long prefills load all three hosts for long stretches: a prompt near 1M tokens keeps them under load for many minutes before its first token, and the reference ring's lowest `MemAvailable` came during such a request ([measurements on 1.24.0](benchmarks.md#measurements-on-1240)). Let the hosts cool between such requests ([GPU clock cap](#gpu-clock-cap)).

## Supervision, stall detection and warmup

### Memory reserve and stall detection

The foreground supervisor on each rank samples `MemAvailable` every 2 seconds and stops its own container below `resources.reserve_gib` (`stop-reason: memory-reserve`). On rank 0 it also reads `/metrics` in the same cycle when `resources.stall_seconds` is positive: if requests are running and none of the generation-token count, prompt-token count, KV-cache usage and running count has moved for that long, it stops with `stop-reason: engine-stall` and records the frozen sample. `/health` keeps answering 200 while the engine is wedged (the V1 health check does not probe the workers), so it is not a liveness signal. KV usage moves during a chunked prefill and the prompt-token count is added at the first output token, so a long prompt is not a stall; the template's 600 s equals `generation.timeout_seconds` and covers the longest measured request, 493 s for a 256K reference request with chunk 2048 before FA2 prefill. An unreachable `/metrics` is no evidence and never counts. The reference hosts measured why KV usage belongs in the set: during an 82,018-token prefill the two token counters stayed frozen for 202.8 seconds, while the four signals together never froze for more than 8.3 seconds. A detector watching only tokens would have to sit above the longest prefill it will ever serve. A supervised stop leaves the other ranks running; stop them before starting a new launch, because `cluster switch` refuses an incomplete one. These notes were informed by the field runbook in Mia PR #70; in both incidents there, killing the containers, confirming the GPU with a short CUDA probe and restarting recovered the kit without a power cycle.

### What each sample records

Each line of `resources.jsonl` records `mem_free_gib` and `free_2mib_gib`, the free memory in buddy blocks of 2 MiB or more summed over zones from `/proc/buddyinfo`. NVRM allocates such blocks without reclaiming the page cache, as described in tonyd2wild's GB10 memory notes (no code adopted), which fits `NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY` appearing with more than 4 GiB available. On the reference head while serving, 7.1 GiB available came with 1.1 GiB free and 0.49 GiB in such blocks. Both readings are observations: only `MemAvailable` stops a rank, and an unreadable sample is recorded as `memory_sample_error` instead of stopping one. The same notes report that raising `vm.min_free_kbytes` to 4 GiB lowered vLLM's startup memory check by about 6.2 GiB, so this kit leaves it at the distribution default.

Every sample also records the container's cgroup memory and the summed `VmRSS`/`RssAnon` of its processes (`container_cgroup_gib`, `container_rss_gib`, `container_anon_gib`), read without privileges from cgroup v2 and `/proc`. On GB10 the GPU shares host memory and device allocations are charged to neither, so when a rank stops with `memory-reserve` the record itself tells the two cases apart: a flat cgroup and flat RSS beside a falling `MemAvailable` is growth on the device side (seen with decode Graphs during a 200K prefill), rising RSS is growth in the processes. An unreadable observation is recorded as `container_memory_error` and never stops the rank.

### Swap

The reference hosts keep 16 GiB of swap for host pages. `vm.swappiness=0` stops new page-outs but leaves pages that are already swapped where they are, and touching old swapped pages during a long prefill was reported as the trigger of a GB10 UVM livelock (same source). Cycle residual swap while every container of the launch is down: `sudo swapoff -a && sudo swapon -a`. Keep the swap file itself; with no swap at all the worker was killed on allocation spikes. On 2026-09-17 the reference pair compared `vm.swappiness` 60 and 0 at chunk 2048, cycling swap before the 0 arm. At 60 no engine process had swapped pages; 0.38 GiB on the head and 0.28 GiB on the peer belonged to other processes, such as a search container and the desktop shell. At 0 swap stayed empty, prefill differed by 1.9%, within the variation between restarts, and the head's lowest free memory was 0.45 GiB lower while the peer's was 0.31 GiB higher. No benefit showed for this workload, so the hosts stay at the distribution's 60. Another two-Spark recipe requires 0 persisted in `/etc/sysctl.d` (tonyd2wild OPEN-PROBLEMS §4, no code adopted); measure on your own load before persisting it.

### Host daemons

**Host daemons compete for the same unified memory.** The supervisor stops the model when `MemAvailable` falls below the reserve, but the cause can be another process on the host, and then the model stops while the cause remains. On 2026-09-16 the peer rank stopped at 2.49 GiB against a 2.5 GiB reserve. The cause was a monitoring dashboard on the other host that opened a new SSH login to the peer for every metric it sampled, 3.6 logins per second. Each login created a logind session and a polkit check, so `polkitd` grew to 3.40 GiB over six days; each session change made `wireplumber` re-register its Bluetooth audio profiles, which `bluetoothd` rejected as already registered, so both of those grew too (to 0.69 and 1.15 GiB); and each login ran every `/etc/update-motd.d` script, about 660 new processes per second. The host running the dashboard reads its own metrics locally and stayed at 0.03 GiB. Enabling OpenSSH connection reuse for the dashboard's host aliases (`ControlMaster auto`, `ControlPersist`) took the peer from 218 logins a minute to none, with the dashboard's readings unchanged. Before a long run, count logins on each host with `journalctl -u ssh --since -60s | grep -c Accepted` and compare daemon sizes with `ps -eo user,rss,comm --sort=-rss | head`. A `MemoryMax` drop-in on a daemon that leaks also needs `Restart=on-failure`, because these units ship `Restart=no` and would otherwise stay dead once the cap kills them. Finally, a half-dead launch is invisible from the API: a surviving head keeps answering `/health` with 200, so check `docker ps` on every host.

**How the cause was found, and what held afterwards.** Counting new process and thread IDs separated the hosts (6,642 in 10 seconds on the peer against 176 on the head), and `journalctl -u ssh` traced the logins to the dashboard; Bluetooth was a symptom, not the cause. With connection reuse the peer's churn stopped, and after a power cycle the three daemons kept their size. The `polkitd` cap set during the incident (`MemoryMax=512M`, `Restart=on-failure`) stays on the peer as a second layer; its restart has not been exercised.

### A lost peer

**A lost peer is not detected while the launch is idle.** Mia issue #193 reports a head host that stopped answering on every network during sustained TP=2 serving and needed a physical reboot, with nothing logged before it; the worker kept running and held more than 100 GB until an operator stopped it. Two points carry over. Each supervisor runs on the host it guards, so a host lockup takes its supervisor with it: the reserve guards against the model exhausting unified memory, not against the host locking up. And an idle half-dead launch is stopped by no supervisor: memory stays above the reserve, and stall detection needs a running request. A stop reason for a lost peer, with each rank checking the others, is a design note and is not implemented.

### Warmup ladder

`server warmup` sends a request ladder through the ordinary chat endpoint after readiness: a short text turn at the profile's temperature and one at the checkpoint's sampling (temperature 1.0, top_p 0.95, what a client that sends no temperature gets), a tool call, one synthetic image (when `runtime.vision` is on) and, when `generation.warmup_long_tokens` is set, a prompt of that many tokens sized with the served tokenizer. These are the shapes that were observed compiling kernels while serving ([image input](vision.md#limits-and-open-items)); the pinned launch disables vLLM's own JIT warmup, and one such compile burst pushed the head below its memory reserve. Compiled kernels persist in the runtime cache, but the ladder still reports them on every start: the pinned Triton calls its post-compile hook on the first use of a kernel in a process whether the binary was compiled or loaded from the on-disk cache, and the jit monitor warns from that hook (its TileLang check likewise looks only at the in-process cache). What the ladder moves before the first user request is that per-process load. The record (`records/<stamp>-warmup-r0/result.json`) lists each rung's seconds, prompt tokens and outcome, the kernels the jit monitor reported before and during the ladder, and whether the prefix cache was reset afterwards (only with `api.dev_endpoints = true`; otherwise the warmup prompts stay in the cache until evicted).

The last rung is a correctness canary, after MiaAI-Lab recipe #268 (no code adopted): it asks for the numbers 1 to 80 at temperature 0 and effort low, up to 256 tokens (the prompt and limits are the constants of `glm53_setup/warmup.py`). The launch is degenerate when the answer is not exactly 1 to 80 or does not finish with `stop`, or when MTP is on and this rung drafted at least 64 tokens (upstream's threshold) with none accepted. The count is long enough for the draft check to judge from this rung alone, whichever other rungs a profile runs: on 2026-09-28 the pair answered in 168 tokens and drafted 126 at effort low, and 207 and 162 at max (a one-word answer drafted 69 over the whole AXL ladder, and fewer rungs would not have reached 64). A rung that could not be sent, unreadable metrics or fewer drafts leave the verdict open and never count. With `generation.warmup = true`, `cluster switch` runs the ladder on rank 0 after both ranks are ready and before it writes the profile text, and stores the result under `warmup` in `result.json`. A degenerate verdict fails the switch and restores the old pair, as a failed readiness does; any other ladder failure is recorded and leaves the new pair serving. `cluster resume` runs the same ladder, and stops a degenerate resumed pair instead of restoring the old one, whose launches are not in its record.

The long rung pays a full prefill on every start (measured before FA2 prefill, 1.5.0, with chunk 2048: about 490 s at 256K and 380 s at 200K; with 512: about 500 s at 200K and 206 s at 82K; current full-length prefill times are in [benchmarks](benchmarks.md)). On the reference hosts every ladder reports the same ten kernels, among them `BuildPrefillChunkMetadataKernel` and the TileLang `mhc_pre_big_fuse_with_norm_tilelang` shape that had once compiled while serving a user request; across five starts on 2026-09-17 the runtime cache (1,840 Triton and 55 TileLang files) gained no file, and the short rungs took 1–2 s. One shape of `BuildPrefillChunkMetadataKernel` appears only partway through a long request. The indexer splits the query side once one request's query length times its compressed sequence length exceeds the `VLLM_SPARSE_INDEXER_MAX_LOGITS_MB` budget (512 in the pinned image); every slice after the first then starts at a non-zero offset and asks Triton for a different specialization. The compression ratio is `index_kpool`, 4, so splitting starts at an input of 134,217,728 ÷ `max_num_batched_tokens` × 4 tokens. At 2048 that is 262,144, and the test is less-than-or-equal, so even a request that fills the shipped 256K window is never split. At 4096 it starts at 131,072 and at 8192 at 65,536. When you raise the chunk, or raise `max_model_len` above 262,144, set `generation.warmup_long_tokens` to at least that length so the compile happens at startup. The values were read from the source and settings of the running container (2026-09-18); no request long enough to be split was sent. The mechanism was pointed out by Mia PR #203 (no code adopted); the pinned image's own vLLM warmup keys already list all three classes, so that fix is not needed here.

## GPU clock cap

GB10 machines (DGX Spark and compatibles) are widely reported to power off under sustained GPU load, leaving no log and staying off until the power button is pressed. The reference pair's head did so once, on 2026-09-27, on the second of two back-to-back 261,573-token prefills after about 54 minutes of long-input load. Accumulated heat and the power peak of prefill are the likely causes; with no temperature or power record from that moment, this is not certain.

The mitigation that works in those reports is capping the GPU clock at 2,200 MHz instead of the default of about 2,418 MHz (`nvidia-smi -lgc 300,2200`; a power limit through `-pl` has no effect on GB10). The reference pair and its neighbor apply it at every boot and record temperatures, power and clock every two seconds. **The [README's headline measurements](../README.md#what-has-been-verified) were taken under this cap.** Against the same profile without the cap, prefill was about 2% slower and long inputs took 1–5% longer, while decode, NLL, completions and correctness did not change ([measurements](benchmarks.md#both-profiles-in-one-window-with-a-gpu-clock-cap-2026-09-28)). The cap is a host setting; this repository's launcher does not apply it. Benchmarks that send long requests one after another should rest between them.

### Shared-memory reader spin

Every template also shortens the spin of vLLM's shared-memory broadcast readers from 1 s to 2 ms (`runtime.shm_spin_seconds = 0.002`; the key in [server configuration](server-configuration.md), the decision in [catalog P29](optimization-catalog.md#performance-initiatives)). On the reference pair only the head's EngineCore spun, and the shorter spin lowered its CPU load and the head's temperature for a small decode cost ([measurements on 1.25.0](benchmarks.md#measurements-on-1250)). A host that runs warm under concurrent load benefits most; to restore vLLM's 1 s, remove the key, and nothing is mounted or set. Like the clock cap, it does not replace rest between long requests.

## Recovery and records

The scripts do not delete failed containers or weights and do not install a restart watchdog. `server stop` stops only a container carrying this launcher's ownership label. Save its logs and rename a stopped container before recreating the same rank name. Reinitialize every rank together after a distributed failure.

`state/` holds current acquisition/site state. `records/` holds per-run evidence. A paused acquisition is an intentional stop: verification waiting exits with code 2 and does not restart the download. Do not start a new acquisition while a local transfer is in progress.

Detailed numerical and backend limitations are in [validation.md](validation.md). Keep unresolved failures visible when preparing a release.
