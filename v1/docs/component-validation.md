# CUDA and indexer component validation

[日本語](component-validation.ja.md)

The unpack/indexer measurements below use the pinned two-GB10 target, runtime source `74548eeac4ca5abe9f0036b3ac89f77555a31ec7` and image `sha256:32394330800422a71df89c89d399b8bd17d2dbe90806572ea4583f15ad46f09a` on both ranks. The later Graph fixture has its own scope and source identities below. These are experimental measurements, not production or language-quality qualification.

## Conditions

TP=2, Marlin W4A16, FP8 KV, eager, one sequence, no prefix caching, **LPA/MTP disabled**. The component worker changes only unpack mode between exclusive requests. Input uses the validation split of the retained LLM-jp corpus (SHA256 `fe1a7ffbf8fe36e9db925c25459863ce0cd432c6fd4ebe0585482dcd41da0ddb`); no held-out test documents were used. Each path has a warmup, followed by five one-output measurements or three 128-output measurements, with temperature=0, seed=42 and fixed output counts. Tracing is inactive during timing.

## Full-target unpack A/B/A

Median client request seconds, including prefill and output generation:

| Input tokens | Output tokens | Unpack off | Fused unpack | Restored off |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 64 | 1 | 0.357 | 0.326 | 0.359 |
| 2,048 | 1 | 6.162 | 5.076 | 6.133 |
| 8,192 | 1 | 24.513 | 20.392 | 24.578 |
| 64 | 128 | 9.361 | 9.349 | 9.370 |
| 2,048 | 128 | 15.231 | 14.068 | 15.171 |
| 8,192 | 128 | 33.535 | 29.285 | 33.418 |

The 8K one-output control improves by about 17%. The 128-output rows include prefill and are **not decode-only rates**. Short-context generation shows little change. These small samples do not establish production tail latency.

Paired traces of the same 64-token input with 1/33 outputs show **1,743→1,710 GPU kernels per additional token** on each rank; CUDA launch API counts match. NCCL remains 92 events per additional token. This reduction of 33 kernels/token is much smaller than the prefill benefit; it must not be described as eliminating the overall decode bottleneck. The separate unpack microbenchmark reduced four kernels to one at full candidate-row sizes (`validation.benchmark_unpack`: at 2,176 and 17,408 records, one and eight full candidate rows, median component time about 0.045 to 0.011 ms and 0.630 to 0.212 ms).

## Numerical scope

GPU component checks matched Torch unpack exactly across all FP8 byte codes and selected FP32 scales, including signed zero, and matched attention output with padding and empty candidates. All full-target one-output A/B/A cases had equal token IDs.

The 128-output cases varied even between native/off repetitions. A separate 32-output logprob diagnostic found ties and changes in candidate probabilities on common prefixes in both off and fused runs. Shared-token logprob differences reached approximately 1.31 in the native repetitions; these are not evidence of uniformly tiny perturbations. This run did not establish full-target deterministic equivalence (identical requests on the full model repeat bit for bit only since the later fixes in [validation](validation.md#repeatability)), and language-quality acceptance was outside its scope. Keep this baseline issue separate from the exact component arithmetic result; do not infer either fusion-specific damage or production qualification from it.

## Indexer observation

The observer attached to all 11 `SparseAttnIndexerKpool` operations and captured logical candidate IDs before shared-buffer overwrite. The following medians sum the CUDA intervals within each rank; **do not add the two ranks together**.

| Input tokens | Rank 0 op sum | Rank 1 op sum | One-output request | Rank 0 fraction |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2,048 | 5.04 ms | 4.94 ms | 6.103 s | 0.083% |
| 8,192 | 34.84 ms | 34.03 ms | 24.562 s | 0.142% |

These intervals include the kpool op's scoring, selection and cache updates. They **exclude upstream indexer projections, normalization, query quantization and gate computation** in the enclosing `Indexer.forward`. They are not an upper bound on every possible indexer optimization. Reindex retains target query work, and mandatory cache writes cannot simply be counted as savings.

At the final query of this 8K validation input, adjacent sparse-layer Jaccard ranged from 0.349 to 0.693, with target-candidate coverage from 0.518 to 0.818. Both ranks agreed on the captured sets. The 2K selections covered all causal tokens and produced trivial Jaccard=1, which is excluded from evidence of useful sparse reuse. These are sampled queries from one fixed validation input, not a general overlap distribution or a tuned layer schedule.

P16 stopped at the cost gate on 2026-09-21 ([indexer reuse](indexer-reuse.md)); these 2K/8K observations are the earlier input to it.

## Reproduction

Use `validation.component_worker=true` with LPA/MTP off and the verified image in the [server configuration](server-configuration.md). On the head, run `python -m glm53_setup.validation.run_components --config /path/to/profile.toml --corpus /path/to/documents.jsonl --output /new/record`. The driver stores all responses, actual token counts, A/B/A repeatability, timing samples and per-rank overlap. Retain the corresponding profiler traces and resource logs.

Integrated results: [P18](benchmarks.md#serial-integration-of-mtp-lpa-fused-unpack-and-async-checks-p18).

## Independent decode Graph fixture

**Decode Graphs (P06): off.** Four-layer fixture, one GB10, context 16,384, chunk 512, one sequence, FP8 KV 512 MiB, Marlin W4A16, seed 42, temperature zero, 32 tokens generated at 64 / 2,048 / 8,192 input tokens. On 2026-09-12 Graph and eager differed at 2K from output token 12, at a logprob tie, while an asynchronous-eager control matched eager. On 2026-09-18, with the expert token order fixed (image `sha256:e7a2a606…`, source `0957c4e`, the [canonical MoE order](server-configuration.md#repeatability-switches) on, MTP k=3, fused unpack, asynchronous index checks, with and without prefix caching), eager and `FULL_DECODE_ONLY` Graphs gave identical 32-token outputs and top-10 logprobs at every length in every run (8 runs, 31 pairs), so the earlier divergence was expert order. No run hit the prefix cache (a hit needs priming beyond the 16,384-token context), so the hit path is not covered. On the full model Graphs decoded slower than eager and were not adopted ([benchmarks](benchmarks.md#decode-graphs-on-the-full-model)). Private runs: `graph-component-v13-results/*`; driver `glm53_setup.validation.run_graph_fixture` at `eb30095`.

## Direct padded native attention probe

**Not adopted** (P05 in the [optimization catalog](optimization-catalog.md)). `glm53_setup.validation.benchmark_native_attention` calls FlashInfer's public sparse MLA API with real FP8 cache packing, 64 zero RoPE dimensions and GLM `arbitrary_fp32` scales, keeping every candidate. The first run (`native-attention-v15`, image `sha256:e18f7ae02e96beeb9af954a4e5600ce6ff534d9f91a9fcc2e440a4d91350c494` from `eb30095`) exceeded the two-BF16-ulp bound at 32 heads (3.03125 on empty rows), and the fixed SM120 v32/GLM decode table accepts only widths 128/512/1024/2048, so 2,051 candidates cannot be padded to 2,176; a prefill-only run (`native-prefill-v16`) was rejected at `GLM_NSA`, top-k 128, page size 64.

**Revisit by row kind (2026-09-17).** `--by-row-kind` at source `adf8ca9`, on an idle GB10 with the serving image `f6fc154c…`, FlashInfer 0.6.18 and width 2048, split the errors by row kind; empty rows were either passed as they are or pointed at slot 0 with their output zeroed afterwards, the handling in Mia's `Dockerfile` and drowzeys WALLS #4/#5/#7 (no code adopted).

| Heads | Query rows | Rows with every candidate | Rows with 17 candidates | Empty rows passed as they are | Empty rows at slot 0, zeroed | Bound |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 32 | 3 (decode kernel) | 0.0078 | 0.0625 | 3.03125 | 0 | 0.031 |
| 32 | 65 (prefill orchestrator) | 0.0083 | 0.0389 | 3.03125 | 0 | 0.027 |
| 64 | 3 | 0.0078 | 0.0547 | 3.03125 | 0 | 0.029 |
| 64 | 65 | 0.0088 | 0.0566 | 3.03125 | 0 | 0.030 |

Zeroing empty rows removes the v15 difference and rows holding every candidate stay within the bound, but rows holding 17 candidates (packed first for three rows and last for 65) exceed it by 1.3–2× under either handling. With all 2,048 candidates valid the kernel took 0.085/0.092/0.413/2.439 ms for 1/8/65/512 rows, against 0.187/1.105/8.831/68.837 ms for the reference under the P04 timing conditions.

Dropping one pool to fit the kernel (2,051 to 2,047 candidates) was measured on synthetic data only (random packed FP8 cache and queries, 64 rows × 32 heads): the largest output change was 0.022, 0.039 or 0.151 for the lowest-mass, a random or the highest-mass pool, against a bound of 0.016. Synthetic attention is nearly uniform, so this does not predict the effect under a real indexer. Using 2,047 candidates would need whole-model quality evidence and a separate decision.

## SM90 FA2 MLA wrapper probe

On 2026-09-17 (Asia/Tokyo), `benchmark_sm90_attention` at source `adf8ca9` called FlashInfer's `BatchMLAPagedAttentionWrapper` the way the pinned vLLM's `FLASHINFER_MLA_SPARSE_SM90` backend does: NoPE (`head_dim_kpe=0`), page size one with each query row's candidates as its KV pages, exact per-row lengths and `causal=False`. The pinned vLLM selects that backend only on compute capability 9, with `fa3`; the probe used `fa2` on GB10 (capability 12.1), on the host and image of the revisit above, without model weights. Informed by sfxnz's `docker/Dockerfile.sm121-v8` and tonyd2wild PR #17 and Issue #20 (no code adopted), which extend that backend to capability 12 with `fa2`.

**FP8 KV is unavailable on GB10 with FlashInfer 0.6.18:** `plan()` raises `FP8 kv_data_type for MLA requires an SM90 (Hopper) device, got SM121.` The probe therefore used BF16 KV decoded from the same packed cache as the reference. The first `plan()` built the NoPE module by JIT in 8.0 s.

The numerical checks passed the same two-BF16-epsilon bound as P04:

- Widths 17/63/64/65/2048/2051/2176 with contiguous and sliced queries: maximum differences 0.00024–0.0039 (bound 0.047). No width limit applied.
- Empty rows, including width 0: exactly zero.
- A sole tail candidate among 2,051: kernel difference 0.0, and omitting the tail changes the reference output by 15.6.
- 64, 128 and 256 rows of 2,176 candidates: finite, maximum difference 0.00049. The NaN reported for FlashInfer 0.6.17 did not appear.

Timing used the P04 conditions: 32 heads, 2,176 valid candidates, the median of five synchronized batches of ten calls. The backend plans once per step and runs once per layer.

| Query rows | Reference (ms) | FA2 run (ms) | FA2 plan (ms) | Reference / FA2 kernels per call |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 0.205 | 0.032 | 0.028 | 27 / 1 |
| 8 | 1.193 | 0.073 | 0.036 | 25 / 1 |
| 65 | 9.082 | 0.569 | 0.041 | 195 / 1 |
| 512 | 70.604 | 3.508 | 0.085 | 1,348 / 1 |

**Result:** the kernel is numerically usable as a component on GB10 and about 20× faster than the reference at 512 rows. Adopted for prefill in 1.6.0 without storing BF16 KV: the cache stays `fp8_ds_mla` and the rows a call touches are unpacked to BF16 per call, because fused unpack, prefix caching, LPA and [canonical candidate order](candidate-order.md) are built on the SM120 packed-cache path ([server configuration](server-configuration.md#attention-cache-and-checkpoint), [full-model prefill](benchmarks.md#prefill-and-decode-on-160)).

## NoPE attention fusion and query batching (P04)

On 2026-09-13 (Asia/Tokyo), two independent GB10 component experiments used image `e18f7ae…`, 32 heads, latent width 512, 2,176 candidate entries per query and packed FP8 cache with arbitrary FP32 scales. Neither changes the serving backend. Synchronous index-range checks remained enabled; Graphs and unpack fusion were off in the reference. Each timing is the median of five batches of ten calls after three warmups, synchronized around each batch. Profiling was separate.

**Larger reference query chunks — not adopted.** `benchmark_query_chunks` at source `10d0fc6`, private run `query-components-v17`, compared internal chunks 8/32/64. This differs from the scheduler chunk in P11. Padding, empty rows and single-tail candidates passed the predefined numerical bound; some nine-query results were not bitwise equal. At 512 queries, all results were bitwise equal, but larger chunks were slower and used more temporary memory:

| Internal query chunk | Median call (ms) | Extra peak live allocation (MiB) | GPU kernels per call |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 8 | 70.473 | 133.42 | 1,348 |
| 32 | 80.245 | 488.75 | 340 |
| 64 | 81.382 | 956.39 | 172 |

Keep the internal default at eight. Fewer launches alone did not improve this workload.

**FP32 fused attention — not adopted.** `fused_nope_attention` and `benchmark_query_chunks --fused-attention` at source `99c7427`, private run `fused-nope-components-v18`, combine cache decoding, FP32 score reduction, online softmax and value accumulation without materializing gathered KV. The kernel preserves all candidates and uses 64-bit addressing. Separate GPU tests compared against FP64 for widths 0/17/65/2048/2051/2176, including noncontiguous queries, exact empty-row zero and a sole valid tail candidate. The declared bound was `2 * BF16 epsilon * max(1, max(abs(reference)))`, not bitwise equivalence or a guarantee of two ulps at every output magnitude.

The timing workload below has fully valid candidate entries; empty-row checks were separate. Query-chunk timings above use masked rows and should not be treated as the identical workload.

| Query rows | Reference (ms) | Fused FP32 (ms) | Reference / fused extra live allocation (MiB) | Reference / fused kernels per call |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 0.192 | 0.446 | 9.93 / 0.031 | 27 / 5 |
| 8 | 1.060 | 1.945 | 79.42 / 0.250 | 25 / 5 |
| 65 | 8.787 | 13.566 | 120.27 / 2.031 | 195 / 5 |
| 512 | 68.154 | 105.006 | 134.24 / 16.000 | 1,348 / 5 |

All outputs were finite and within the declared bound; maximum absolute differences ranged from 0.000122 to 0.000488. The five GPU kernels include range checking around the fused attention kernel. The measured synchronization API count remained four for both paths, including benchmark synchronization. These are component-call counts, not full-model kernels per generated token.

A bounded tiling follow-up (`benchmark_fused_tiles`, private run `fused-tiles-v19b`) tested tile/warps 8/4, 16/4, 16/8 and 32/8. All passed the same bound and compiled without register spills. Best one-query time was 0.389 ms; best 512-query time was 105.039 ms. Neither beat the reference measurements.

The prototypes reduce launches and temporary allocation, but **do not provide a measured speed benefit**. Keep them for reproduction; do not connect them to startup, claim full-model acceptance, or treat the already useful P03 unpack fusion as rejected. Reopen P04 with a materially different execution strategy supported by profiling, rather than further blind tile sweeps.

### Shared-head Tensor Core candidate — not adopted

`validation.fused_nope_dot.dot_nope_tf32x3` is a separate follow-up: each program shares decoded K/V across 16 query heads and uses explicit `tf32x3` matrix products, with FP32 softmax/accumulation and BF16 output. It is not IEEE-equivalent arithmetic; [Triton's dot API](https://triton-lang.org/main/python-api/generated/triton.language.dot.html) defines the precision selection. The benchmark records PTX hashes and checks that TF32 MMA instructions were emitted. It preserves all supplied candidates and shares the existing shape/device/range checks.

The GPU FP64, empty-row and sole-tail-candidate tests passed in `dot-component-v33-results`. The same image `7cb5f93…` ran the isolated component without model weights; all timed outputs were finite and within the predeclared bounds. PTX contained TF32 MMA instructions. However, compilation reported 1,522/1,530 register spills for 16/32 heads, and the kernel was substantially slower. At 512 query rows, reference versus TF32x3 took approximately 63.75→962.42 ms with 16 heads and 68.95→1,945.97 ms with 32 heads. This implementation is **not adopted**; it has no full-model integration or speedup claim. The register-spill evidence is retained for any future redesign.

`benchmark_query_chunks --tf32x3-attention --heads 16` or `--heads 32` reproduces the component in a fresh output directory. Source archive SHA256: `290dd45b32997ecb101e237db74485fbc0437339e1a0419761209b46cf49077d`. Serving remains unchanged and the earlier SIMT/query-chunk rejections stand.

## Pipeline fixture preparation and startup (P17)

The experimental source-pinned model patch propagates BF16 hidden/residual tensors and FP32 deferred mHC post/comb tensors across PP stages. The four-layer, single-GPU control (`pipeline-v17-control-a`) completed three repetitions at each of 64/2,048/8,192 input tokens with 16 outputs, finite chosen-token logprobs and the expected buffer shapes. Image: `sha256:b9ae526c6369b7bac909c2043853f60172e66eecc1b34e891b1faa607284eb4a`. This is a truncated-model control, not PP qualification or a language-quality result.

The first two-stage attempt (`pipeline-v17-pp2-a`) loaded stage weights but failed before readiness: the KDA-only stage reported six supported KV layouts while the KDA/MLA stage reported only `LBHNC`. The pinned resolver required identical lists even though their intersection was nonempty. Both containers were stopped without OOM.

`patch_pipeline_layout` now selects the common supported list for PP=2 while preserving the existing mixed-cache shape checks and requested-layout validation. An empty intersection remains an error; non-PP selection is unchanged. CPU checks cover heterogeneous lists, preference order and empty/disjoint support. The source utility SHA256 is `63f58dd2b29543045109f40897ddc5f57e299bb4259f0e37a64b024cb1f20ddb`; patched SHA256 is `48222663f4fb1842dd4d93e34f6e356ebaa3d4ebe1c15255d0b5bd670359e4d3`. Both nodes built the same candidate image, `sha256:5052db070ec651c0b16f1c72f523d631d4b96ba7a2e2b5c3adce46b3f2cace79`.

The retry (`pipeline-v17-pp2-b`) is **not accepted**: its log showed a mismatch between stage-local Mamba cache specs, and both containers exited without OOM. The fixed GLM cache grouping also explicitly requires an MLA layer on every stage that has Mamba layers. A four-layer model split 2+2 is therefore an unsuitable PP fixture. Do not relax those cache contracts to make it run.

The fixture builder accepts `--layers 8`, providing one KDA/KDA/KDA/MLA block per stage. Both nodes built and byte-verified all 17,526 selected tensors (25,606,617,384 bytes) against the pinned original weights. The eight-layer comparison uses the original `b9ae526…` PP image on both sides; the layout-intersection patch is unnecessary when both stages declare the same support, and has been removed. Its observer records finite attention outputs and active KDA conv/recurrent state as well as transfer hashes. The [server profile](server-configuration.md) can select PP with a matching image.

### Eight-layer PP observations

Private runs `pipeline-v23-control-a` and `pipeline-v23-pp2-a` completed 64/2,048/8,192 input tokens, 16 output tokens and three repetitions per length. Both used eager TP=1, chunk 512, context 16,384, FP8 KV 512 MiB per rank, no MTP/LPA/fusion/APC and identical image/fixture bytes. The control retained all eight layers on one GPU; PP2 placed layers 0–3 and 4–7 on separate GPUs. Observation-source SHA256: `44fcceb70214a951df0e33739fd7a4b11288f517469d083a848e05db9bf671d4`; driver SHA256: `a2d0410e98af0bdd337653911e733f156d8b875926de4e4222accacb7e9f36c2`.

All **198 stage transfers** matched every byte hash, shape and dtype of hidden/residual/post/comb on sender and receiver. All nine generated token sequences matched the PP1 control, and all observed tensors were finite. At 64 tokens, layer outputs, active KDA state and chosen-token logprobs also matched exactly.

Longer inputs were not bitwise invariant. Across 1,584 layer observations containing 2,376 active KDA tensor observations, 677 layer rows differed between PP1 and PP2. The first difference was at layer 6 of the first 2K prefill chunk, beyond the transfer boundary. Both PP1 and PP2 also showed internal repeat variation despite repeated token sequences:

| Input tokens | Maximum cross-arm chosen-logprob difference | Maximum PP1 repeat difference | Maximum PP2 repeat difference |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 64 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2,048 | 0.06609 | 0.06527 | 0.06480 |
| 8,192 | 0.18685 | 0.18307 | 0.18979 |

This does not establish strict numerical equivalence, negligible error or unrestricted language quality. It also does not identify a transfer defect: the actual transmitted tensors match, while repeat variability exists without PP. Retain the diagnostic and compare matched-prefix numerical differences against the baseline before stronger acceptance claims.

Both runs stopped without OOM. Minimum host available RAM was 71.82 GiB for the 48 GiB-capped PP1 control and 87.69/39.71 GiB for the 32 GiB-capped PP2 ranks; the host reserve was 4 GiB. These minima include loading/warmup, not only steady inference. Head stopped with exit 0; peer still required forced termination (exit 137). Observer hashes introduce synchronization and CPU copies, so this is **not a TP2-versus-PP2 speed benchmark**. Full-model result: [P17](benchmarks.md#independent-tp2-versus-pp2-evaluation-p17), not adopted.

## Independent expert placement fixture (P21)

The same byte-verified eight-layer model ran TP=2/PP=1 with EP off, on and restored off (`expert-v24-off-a`, `expert-v24-on-a`, `expert-v24-off-b`). Each arm used the same `b9ae526…` image, eager, one sequence, chunk 512, context 16,384, FP8 KV 512 MiB per rank and no MTP/LPA/fusion/APC. Every arm completed three repetitions at 64/2,048/8,192 input tokens with 16 outputs and finite observed tensors. These truncated-model runs do not measure language-task quality.

Actual `RoutedExperts` objects in all five MoE layers confirmed the intended transition. EP off retained 288 tensor-sharded experts per rank; EP on placed 144 complete experts per rank, with disjoint ownership covering all 288. `MarlinExperts` was selected throughout. MoE TP size changed 2→1 and EP size 1→2, while model TP remained 2 and DP/SP remained 1. The fixed runtime's `use_all2all_kernels` was false in this topology; no DeepEP invocation is claimed. Restored off recovered the original ownership. The observer also recorded actual loaded parameter shapes, dtypes and byte counts.

Ready-time Torch allocation was approximately 12.682 GiB per rank and reservation 14.896 GiB in all arms. This is evidence for the small fixture, not a full-model memory guarantee. All containers stopped without OOM; head exited 0 and peer 137.

Generated tokens matched across arms at 64 and 2K input. At 8K, every arm varied between its own repetitions, and both off→on and off→restored pairs diverged after 2/4/2 common output tokens. Maximum shared-prefix logprob differences were:

| Input tokens | Off versus EP on | Off versus restored off |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 64 | 0.11011 | 0.08337 |
| 2,048 | 0.22505 | 0.08900 |
| 8,192 | 0.06813 | 0.06038 |

EP's 2K probability difference is larger than the restored baseline difference, so this is not a claim of numerical equivalence. Keep the 8K baseline variability and the EP delta visible. **This fixture demonstrates placement, loading and bounded execution.** The subsequent [full-model comparison](benchmarks.md#independent-expert-parallel-evaluation-p21) passed its limited task/capacity checks but did not justify performance adoption. The diagnostic hashes synchronize/copy tensors and were disabled for full-model speed measurements.

EP observer SHA256: `38c2e228ab086d179b06a7663a0879b4871950fdefc65632e4768d9a51541642`; validation driver SHA256: `a12c8aa6705e3df670853ff391bddfea2ff039c72e64b36387117a7e8405a0dc`. Full raw responses and state observations remain private.

## Independent prefix-cache fixture (P19)

`apc-fixture-v41-off/on/restored` used the byte-verified four-layer fixture with the V36 image recorded in [serial integration](benchmarks.md#serial-integration-of-mtp-lpa-fused-unpack-and-async-checks-p18). All arms used TP1/eager, one sequence, context 16,384, chunk 512 and FP8 KV 512 MiB. MTP, LPA, fused unpack and async index checks were off. APC was the changed setting. All arms completed 13 input lengths, three cold/warm pairs per length, 16 output tokens per request and an interleaved-input check, then exited 0 without OOM. Host RAM minima were 89.20/98.04/100.48 GiB under a 32 GiB container cap and 4 GiB reserve.

Although the requested block size was 256, the actual common cache block was 8,704 tokens. Warm requests through 8,704 input tokens reported zero cached tokens; 8,705 and 16,319 inputs each reused 8,704 tokens. The shorter no-hit results must not be counted as successful cache reuse or a quality check of that reuse.

| Input tokens | APC-on cold median | APC-on warm median | Warm cached tokens |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 8,705 | 2.5634 s | 0.2518 s | 8,704 |
| 16,319 | 4.5622 s | 2.2750 s | 8,704 |

These fixture request times include 16 output tokens and may include shape-specific JIT in a first sample; they are not full-model performance claims. Through 8,705 inputs, generated tokens matched across all arms. At 16,319, every arm varied at the first token between the same two candidates: an exact tie or a 0.03125 logprob lead. Off/on pairs matched 3/6 times, while off/restored matched 5/6. Maximum within-arm shared-prefix logprob deltas were about 0.0632. Other lengths also showed probability variation without cache hits; no bitwise equivalence or cause attribution is claimed.

**This fixture demonstrates actual cache reuse and bounded execution.** Its interleaved prompts were only 2K and had no hits, so they do not establish isolation of positively cached requests. The subsequent [full-model A/B/A](benchmarks.md#independent-full-model-prefix-caching-p19) supplies limited real-hit long-document, tool, resource/cancellation and restored-control evidence. Driver SHA256: `da967a4928ab88846c33523fb11c0b9c65234d27f88274ac752c78b3bd8bc198`. LPA/APC uses the separate P22 contract below.

## APC-first LPA cache isolation (P22)

The [P22 fixture](apc-lpa-design.md) uses a deliberately non-teacher projector on the byte-verified four-layer checkpoint. It checks the real cache manager's joint hit, actual query omission, GPU hashes of returned exact-prefix blocks, and a following ordinary request. The synthetic projector is a contamination probe, not a trained language-quality candidate.

`p22-fixture-v50` passed with TP=1/eager, one sequence, context 32,768, chunk 512, FP8 KV 1 GiB, no MTP/fusion/async checks, a 32 GiB container cap and 4 GiB host reserve. Effective worker source SHA256 was `695039966835f037286c89f7de2657cc1423795991ce99ec85120a61cb85009d`; pinned GPU-worker patch SHA256 was `53647920093e7c141f0aad7dcbb033925f867970dcaa9e525a21391474281eb0`. The fixture driver SHA256 was `9bafd1e58c0f94f7b9ce9cbb8f76ec0fc09b7a083cb410110afe4ec937c917ab`.

At N=18,432 and H=8,704, the approximate suffix omitted 9,216 queries in layer 3. All eight hashed prefix tensor views were unchanged. The following exact request still had H=8,704, then grew reusable exact cache to 17,408. A cold approximate request had H=0 and left no reusable prefix. All three exact-control 16-token outputs matched; the synthetic approximation differed in its first distribution. The container exited 0 without OOM, with minimum host availability 91.398 GiB.

`p22-fixture-v57` added MTP k=3, fused unpack and async checks on fixed image `sha256:59eeba6c94db9f1536010f6c258992c203458703dcf1e23b0bde7cb53d445716`, source `f7b47fc`. The measured block was 8,960; MTP replay required exact priming through 17,921 tokens to restore H=8,960. At N=27,904, all eight requests completed, shared-prefix hashes stayed unchanged, the approximate suffix did not extend shared reuse, and subsequent ordinary computation grew it to 17,920. The container cap was 48 GiB with a 4 GiB host reserve.

**Its strict token-identity criterion did not pass.** The first exact control and the later two exact controls diverged at output position 9: one top candidate led by 0.0625 in the first control, while four candidates tied in the other path; maximum shared-token logprob difference at that first divergence was 0.061949. The exact request following approximation matched the restored exact control. The failed result and exit 1 are retained, rather than relabeled as a numerical pass.

A separate `native-apc-mtp-v58` diagnostic ran six exact-prime/exact-follow-up pairs with **no LPA owner ever constructed**. It reproduced both complete 16-token paths seen above. This establishes that the observed branching also occurs without LPA. It does not prove bitwise stability or general language quality. Cache-isolation evidence, strict numerical identity and subsequent full-model task/performance acceptance remain distinct results.

`p22-fixture-v62` then exercised the asynchronous scheduler on source `3df93c9`, image `sha256:0de1ef13b7bfebb088ac7d9399e2d45decf058f16819d72f5a8e89c1bc993b81`. The CPU cursor can be ahead of the GPU after rejected MTP drafts; the LPA guard now recognizes this only in generated-token decode and still rejects any mismatch inside the prompt. Both approximate requests observed 13 such corrections. All eight requests, cache-boundary checks and unchanged-prefix hashes passed; the three exact 16-token controls also matched in this run, which exited 0 without OOM. The earlier native-only variability remains a separate retained result. The full-model combination is in [benchmarks](benchmarks.md#apclpa-with-mtp-fusion-and-asynchronous-checks-p22).

**MTP depth 2 with LPA (2026-09-26).** On an image built from the 1.18.0 source (`sha256:03c12804…`) and the byte-verified four-layer MTP fixture (stock weights, one GB10, other workloads left running), each check ran at depth 3 as the control and at depth 2. `apc-lpa-fixture` passed at both depths: exact controls equal, the synthetic state distinguished, restored prefixes 8,960 tokens at depth 3 and 8,704 at depth 2. `lpa-fixture` with the documented lengths (3 to 513 and 8,705) passed at depth 3; at depth 2 one run passed every length and a second missed only length 512, where the oracle token differed while the oracle state and the full-MLP oracle matched and the largest shared log-probability difference (0.062) was the size of the passing runs' — the near tie described above for depth 3, not a depth-2 fault. With the runner's default lengths both depths also failed only the one-token prompt, in the baseline itself. The full model has not run LPA at depth 2.

## Additional history fixtures

`fixture-v66-target` and `fixture-v66-mtp3` used source `441384c`, image `sha256:569538ce8b1c259f3ee13242f387320417b2d63a0b4122b6dc74d92ae74dae33`. Each completed 62 requests, including 18 edit/branch conditions at pool boundaries, scheduler-block boundaries and 10/50/90% positions. Original shared-prefix hashes remained unchanged in every condition, edited requests never restored beyond their changed prefix, and exact revisits retained the original shared states. The runtime difference from `3df93c9` was a read-only cache-layout RPC; forward and cache-publication algorithms were unchanged.

The target fixture passed strict control identity and exited 0. The MTP3/fusion/async fixture **failed strict control identity and exited 1**: its first exact control followed one previously observed path, while trial/restored followed the other. Independent comparison found both complete 16-token paths in the earlier six-pair native-only `v58` diagnostic. Its 18 state-isolation conditions passed; that does not turn its numerical failure into a pass. Neither container was OOM-killed. Full-model task and operational acceptance remain separate from bitwise repeatability.

## Cold-cache FA2 startup (2026-09-20)

An eight-layer, byte-verified stock fixture (23.91 GiB loaded weights) on one GB10 compared an unset JIT parallelism environment with `MAX_JOBS=2` and `FLASHINFER_NVCC_THREADS=1`. Both used the 1.6.0 source, reference image `3a396af5…`, Marlin W4A16, FA2 prefill, one sequence, eager mode, 16,384 context, 512-token chunks and 512 MiB FP8 KV. Each arm had a new empty runtime cache, including the NVIDIA driver cache. Existing caches, OS page cache and swap were left intact. Other GPU services were stopped for the comparison and restored afterwards.

| Observation | Unset | 2 / 1 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Load start to engine ready | 270.36 s | 266.50 s |
| First 2,048-token request after ready | 9.26 s | 8.91 s |
| Lowest host MemAvailable during startup and request | 71.38 GiB | 71.11 GiB |
| Lowest host MemAvailable during that request | 80.12 GiB | 80.94 GiB |
| Maximum observed nvcc / cicc processes | 3 / 1 | 2 / 1 |

Both exited successfully without OOM, invoked FA2 eight times in the measured request and returned the same single token. Fresh FA2 NoPE shared libraries and Triton, TileLang, Inductor and NVIDIA cache files were confirmed. These checks establish execution, not language quality. Host/process sampling was every two seconds and can miss short peaks.

**Decision: keep the unset environment.** The only run-time FlashInfer build is the FA2 NoPE module (three translation units, on the fixture and on the reference pair), so an unrestricted Ninja runs three nvcc at once and `MAX_JOBS=2` removes at most one. That happens once per new JIT cache, and FlashInfer already defaults to one NVCC thread. In the multi-nvcc window the two arms differed by under 1 GiB, which one run per arm cannot separate from noise. The fixture's lowest reading fell during weight loading, not during JIT.

### Driver JIT cache (2026-09-20)

The same eight-layer fixture on one GB10 (the 1.6.0 source, image `3a396af5…`, eager, no MTP) launched four times from copies of one primed cache, in the order cold, warm, warm, cold, where "cold" emptied only the NVIDIA driver's JIT cache (`CUDA_CACHE_PATH`). With only that cache empty, launches were no slower than with every cache warm: 189.8 and 172.3 s against 203.9 and 197.0 s to ready, with the same first-request time (0.82–0.84 s) and memory floor. The fully cold priming launch took 278.3 s; the caches already kept under `/root/.cache` account for about 80–100 s of it. Decision: [catalog P10](optimization-catalog.md#performance-initiatives).
