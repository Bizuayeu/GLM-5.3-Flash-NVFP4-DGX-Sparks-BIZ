# HLE (Humanity's Last Exam)

[日本語](hle.ja.md) · [Validation](validation.md)

This page records how the served model answered two 100-question subsets of [HLE](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cais/hle), text and image, each on both profiles, under a bounded budget on this hardware. **Its numbers are not comparable with published HLE values** and are not to be placed beside them:

- **Budget.** Each answer had at most 16,384 new tokens. The pinned model card reports its benchmarks (GPQA Diamond among them) with up to 327,680. Answers cut off by the budget (`finish_reason` `length`) are counted as missing, not wrong, so a correct rate here covers only the questions the model finished.
- **Sampling.** Temperature 1.0 and top_p 0.95, as the pinned model card and `generation_config.json` give, with reasoning effort low (the profile's `generation.reasoning_effort`, which the runner sends).
- **Judging.** Answers were graded off the model host: an exact match after normalization settles an answer, and every other extracted answer went to two judges, Claude Opus 5.5 (effort low) and Claude Sonnet 5, through the Claude Code CLI. This is not HLE's official judge; both judges' counts are reported.
- **Questions.** Not the full set. The text set is 100 exact-answer questions without images, sampled in proportion to subject for a separate evaluation; the image set is 100 exact-answer questions with images, drawn the same way. Both are pinned by hash.

Questions, answers and grades are private records marked `teacher_excluded`. The dataset asks that its data never appear in training corpora, so no public document quotes a question, an answer or a question ID.

## Results

| Set | Profile | Answered (stopped with an extractable answer) | Correct among the stopped answers: Opus 5.5 low / Sonnet 5 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Text | Distribution defaults (2026-09-28 to 09-30) | **61 of 100** | **9 / 10 of 62** (4 by exact match; the judges disagree on 1) |
| Text | Published option (2026-09-30) | **59 of 100** | **8 / 8 of 59** (4 by exact match; the judges agree) |
| Image | Published option (2026-09-30 to 10-01) | **73 of 100** | **12 / 12 of 73** (3 by exact match; the judges agree) |
| Image | Distribution defaults (2026-10-01 to 10-03) | **79 of 100** | **14 / 15 of 79** (3 by exact match; the judges disagree on 1) |

Text on the distribution defaults (1.19.0 image `99e6cf7a…`, run `c-default-text`): 62 answers stopped and 38 reached the budget; one stopped answer had no extractable answer line. No question reached the 1,200 s client timeout; the longest took 921 s.

The other three runs used the same image; the published option was the pair's served profile at two sequences. Text on the published option: 59 stopped, 41 reached the budget, longest 682 s. Image on the published option: 73 stopped, 25 reached the budget and 2 were refused; image on the defaults: 79 stopped, 19 reached the budget and the same 2 were refused (HTTP 400, images of 7,950 and 7,980 tokens; see [how it was run](#how-it-was-run)), longest 725 s and 940 s. Every stopped answer had an extractable answer line. Each set is one run of 100 questions, so the binomial spread is about ±10 points: the differences between the profiles (2 points on text, 6 on images) are inside it and their direction is not read. Images were answered more often than text on both profiles.

## How it was run

On the Linux model host, with the served profile running:

~~~sh
python -m glm53_setup hle --questions <pinned question file> --config state/server.toml \
  --output records/<new-run> --label <profile> \
  --max-tokens 16384 --temperature 1.0 --top-p 0.95 --timeout 1200 --max-new 1
~~~

The question file is exported off the host and carries no reference answers. The runner asks one question at a time through the serving API, saves each answer on its own and resumes without resending answered questions; `--max-new 1` pauses after each question so a driver can rest the hosts. `--limit` makes a labeled pilot, never a full-set result.

A question the server refuses with an HTTP client error (4xx other than 401 and 403) is saved with `finish_reason` `rejected` and its HTTP status, and the run goes on to the next question; like an answer cut off by the budget, it counts as missing, not wrong. Authentication and server errors, timeouts and lost connections still stop the run, which then resumes from the next unanswered question. The refusals seen here are the encoder-cache gap for the largest images ([image input](vision.md#limits-and-open-items)).

Why this budget: a five-question pilot on the published option at temperature 0 and 8,192 tokens reached the limit on every question without a final answer, and one question given 32,768 spent them all on reasoning. The run therefore took the checkpoint's sampling and 16,384 tokens, which fits the 1,200 s timeout at the slowest decode measured.

Operational notes. The text set on the defaults ran as two overnight batches: switch to the defaults, check decode, answer questions, switch back to the published option and check decode again. Before each question the driver waited until both hosts had cooled (below 60 °C, at most 600 s, from the seventh question on; a stricter band before), and both hosts ran under the [GPU clock cap](operations.md#gpu-clock-cap) of 2,200 MHz.
