"""Zero-padding for tensor-parallel sizes that do not divide GLM-5.3-Flash's geometry.

The pinned vLLM shards 64 attention and KDA heads, a 2,048-wide MoE intermediate and a
154,880-token vocabulary evenly across ranks, so TP=3 stops at config time. With
``GLM53_TP_PAD_MULTIPLE=m`` the patched config reports ``ceil(64 / m) * m`` heads (66
for m=3) and the smallest MoE width of at least 2,048 whose per-rank share (width / m)
is a multiple of 64 (2,112, 704 per rank), and the vocabulary pads to ``lcm(64, m)``
(192). The patched loaders zero-extend a checkpoint tensor before they take a rank's
shard, so padded heads, rows and columns are exactly zero; a single-GPU fixture measured
that as exact for KDA, MLA, shared experts and the vocabulary, and within the sharding's
own error for the Marlin NVFP4 MoE (2026-09-29). The knob is
independent of the tensor-parallel size: TP=1 with m=3 reads the padded model on one
GPU. Unset (or 1) every patched path is the pinned code: the config is unchanged and the
loaders run the pinned narrow. ``patch_tp_padding`` installs the call sites. The
mechanism (pad before the narrow, and a config view the MTP draft also reads) follows
FlyCockpit's MIT recipe for TP=3 on three DGX Sparks; no code is taken from it.

# cc-defer: FlashInferMLASparseMetadataBuilder (v1/attention/backends/mla/
# flashinfer_mla_sparse.py) takes its reorder-batch threshold from a table keyed
# by heads per rank, {8, 16, 32: 128, 64: 256, 128: 1024}, default 1024. 22 heads
# (TP=3) and 66 (TP=1 with m=3) fall to 1024, so steps of up to 1024 query tokens
# count as decodes (TP=2's 32 heads: 128). Left as pinned: the TP=3 measurements of
# 1.24.0 ran with it. Revisit if a decode/prefill difference is traced to that split.
