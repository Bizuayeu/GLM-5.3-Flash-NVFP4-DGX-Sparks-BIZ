"""Source-pinned patch: the kpool raw-tail ring holds the drafts that follow a pool-completing one.

vLLM 385dce36 gives every request one circular tail block of ``index_kpool`` (4) slots and stashes
each speculative draft's raw key and gate into ``pos % kpool`` before the draft is verified. With
``num_speculative_tokens >= 2``, a draft that completes a pool can be rejected while the drafts
behind it have already overwritten the slots of that pool's earlier, committed keys; the redo of the
rejected position then compresses the wrong keys into the indexer cache. The damage is to sparse
top-k selection once decode has built pools past ``index_topk`` (2,048 tokens); the MLA KV is
untouched. Upstream: vllm-project/vllm pull request #58454 (merged 2026-09-25 as ``2617fe93``),
which widens the ring to ``kpool * next_power_of_2(cdiv(kpool + num_spec, kpool))`` slots (4
without speculation, 8 for depths 1 to 4, 16 for depth 5) and addresses the tail by the ring
instead of the pool; upstream calls it a partial fix of issues #56868 and #56605. This is the same
change on the pinned source, in two files: the tail cache spec, and the seed and decode kernels of
``kpool_compress.py``. The kernel file is the one ``patch_kpool_seed`` already rewrote, so its hash
is that of the seed patch's output and this patch applies only after it.
