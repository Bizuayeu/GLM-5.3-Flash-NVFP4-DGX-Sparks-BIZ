"""Teacher-forced agreement with a reference run, per token.

Quality gates so far (FreedomBench, tool-eval, MTP acceptance) score answers.
None says how often the model's next-token choice still equals the unmodified
server's choice. This module feeds fixed, self-authored texts through
``/v1/completions`` with ``prompt_logprobs`` and records, per position, the
rank and log-probability of the actual next token. A later run on a changed
server (requantized projections, a different attention kernel, a reduced
candidate set) is compared with the saved reference position by position.

Two readings, kept apart:

* teacher-forced: how often the actual token is rank 1 / within the top five,
  and its mean negative log-probability. This is the number SAGE-style model
  cards report against the native checkpoint.
* agreement: between two runs on the same text, how often the argmax token is
  the same, how much of the top-k overlaps, and how far the actual token's
  log-probability moved.

Nothing here talks to a server or a file; the callers pass senders in.
