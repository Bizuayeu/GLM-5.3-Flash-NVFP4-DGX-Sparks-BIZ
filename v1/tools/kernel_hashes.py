"""Hash the indexer's kernels inside both serving workers and compare the ranks, and an earlier launch.

Through the memory probe's ``kernel_hashes`` method (`validation.memory_probe = true`, dev route
``/collective_rpc``) each rank runs the kpool indexer's computations on fixed inputs in its own
process (the fp32 head gate, the fused FWHT quantisation, the pool cache's writes, DeepGEMM's paged
MQA logits and the stable top-k) and hashes every output. On 2026-09-23 one rank's copy of the
replicated indexer was the first call to differ between two launches, while thirteen fresh
processes on one GB10 computed these kernels bit-identically; so the question is asked of the
serving processes themselves, after every switch. Exit status 1 when the ranks disagree or a hash
differs from the reference record (the keys are printed).

Before hashing, it reads the Inductor autotuners alive in each worker (``autotuners``) and records
the config each rank serves: on 2026-09-24 the two hosts' autotune caches held different configs
for the kernel that normalises the indexer's key, and the configs differ in bits. Rank differences
there are printed, not counted in the exit status, since several kernels differ by design.
